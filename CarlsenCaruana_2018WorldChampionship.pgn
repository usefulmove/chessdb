relatively solid openings at the beginning of the WCC matches. Magnus

{ Here Hikaru didn't allow White to go for f4. The position becomes a
pretty manoeuvre one, where a stronger player is likely to win. Computers
give modest edge for White, but Black has also an easy play on his own: to re-route the knight and then start the pawn offensive on the kingside:

is even nicer, as it controls all important squares } 13.Rf2 h6 14.Qd2 g5 $5
{ Restraining White pieces. Honestly, I don't know what is White's best bet
here, as he lacks visible improvements. It would be lovely to get the
h2-knight to f5, but how? Also loosening Black's queenside is not at all that easy. a4 can always be parried by a5, while it's not easy to achieve b4
in a comfortable way. Therefore I think Magnus won the opening duel, and now the Challenger move by move was using a large ammount of time. }

than none. } 16...O-O-O

some minute activity, but it may evaporate easily, and pawn down is pawn

{ A fighting, nerve-racking, and unpleasant game for both players. Fabiano
Caruana didn't manage to get even the slightest of an opening initiative,
and quickly had to defend himself. Magnus Carlsen on the other hand was winning several times before the 40th move, but in time trouble he spoiled
what looked like an easy win, and had to settle for the endgame which was drawn. Still 11 games to come, and it seems it will be an entertaining match. }

{ The second game of the match was much more in line with the kind of thing
I expect in early rounds than the first one was. Unsurprisingly Black
equalized without much trouble- this tends to be pretty easy to do with months of preparation time and your opponent not knowing what was coming. But
unlike the first game, it never really strayed far from equality. Rounds 3 and 4 when each player plays their second game with White, knowing what may be coming, tend to be the time people seriously start fighting for advantages early on. }

{ Caruana does not go into the QGA, which he has relied on heavily for the
last couple years. } ) 4.Nc3 Be7

certainly has played it off and on in the past, so it can't be considered a
huge surprise. } 5.Bf4 O-O 6.e3 c5 $5
{ The first interesting moment. Caruana chooses a less common move than the
typical Nbd7, which he has played a lot in the past with reasonable
success. } ( 6...Nbd7 { Is much more common. } ) 7.dxc5 Bxc5 8.Qc2 Nc6 9.a3
Qa5 10.Rd1
{ Thus far, there have been some minor surprises, but this position is
still well known and Black is supposed to be doing all right. Nakamura and
Anand have played the Black side a fair amount, and with perfectly reasonable results. But nearly every recent game has continued with Re8, and
Caruana chose something else. } 10...Rd8 $5

games played by anyone over 2600. } ( 10...Re8

see in future games if this line is repeated and e goes for the more
principled move. } ( 11.Nd2
{ Is of course the critical try. This is the main move against Re8, and
makes just as much sense now because the e6-e5 thrust loses power. White
threatens Nb3 and can quickly get a good position if Black is not careful. It would be interesting to know what Caruana had in mind here, and we
may well find out in subsequent games. My best guess would be he thought simplifying with }

symmetry and Black's lack of weaknesses likely mean he should hold. Only
future games will be able to tell if this is truly the case. } ) 11...Ne4 $1

preparation. Black's position is pretty safe. } 14.a4 Ne7 $1

he is not going to be in any real danger. } ( 15.Rb1

accurate not to be worse, but his moves are not too hard to find and I
doubt Magnus was particularly worried. } ( 15...f6 16.Ng6 e5

have been my choice, when White's moves seem harder to find than they were
in the game. Still, after } 17.Bg3 Be6 18.cxd5 $1 ( 18.Nxe7+ $2 Bxe7 19.cxd5

{ Black somehow just loses as he cannot escape the pin. Kh7 would walk into
several deadly discoveries. } ) 19.Bc4 $1
{ Simple and strong, but also not too difficult. White should have enough
counterplay to maintain the balance, though I still would take Black in a
practical game, and I think this may have been a more promising option than Caruana's choice. }

use of his better structure on the long term. } ) 16.cxd5 Nxd5 17.Bf3 ( 
17.Nxf7

certainly would not have changed the result. Still, it would have looked
nicer for Magnus than what he got in the game. } 17...Kxf7 18.Bxd6 Rxd6

c6, though even then it's very likely still a draw. Magnus forced matters
right away. } 28.a6 $1 b6 29.c5 $1 Kd7 ( 29...b5 $2

win with the b-pawn shoving. But he is a tempo too slow and loses after the
simple } 30.c6 ) 30.cxb6 axb6 31.a7 Ra8 32.Rxb6 Rxa7
{ Black will win the d6-pawn, but the position is a dead draw. In fact,
White's doubled f-pawns make the defense even easier than it would be with
a "healthier" structure of f2-g3-h4 because the king has a permanent happy home on g2, and Black can never get his pawns going past the fourth rank
without massive trades. } 33.Kg2 e5 34.Rb4 f5 35.Rb6 Ke6 36.d7+ Kxd7 37.Rb5

{ Caruana understandably did not feel like trying further- he would never
win. The match is of course wide open after the first two games. Still, I'd
say the chessplaying trend is favoring Magnus, since he is the only one who has had any chances to strike yet, but the psychological advantage has to
be on Caruana's side after today as he easily equalized with Black just like Magnus did, but unlike Magnus, he did not blow half a point. It will be interesting to see what happens on Monday, and if the Sicilian will be repeated. It certainly could, but I would not be surprised at all to see either
side deviate. } 1/2-1/2

encounters, this one was much more notable and interesting. It was the

possible, not allowing e4-e5. } 6.b4 $5

me happy to watch, as it looks sharp and interesting. The most dangrous
scenario for Carlsen would now to be unprepared for this move. But actually he had faced it before! }

probably ready for this line. } ( 6...cxb4

compensation for a pawn at least, but if he is better or not remains a
question. Black went on to win a fighting game in 0-1 (44) Rapport,R (2676) -Granda Zuniga,J (2665) Camarinas 2013 }

king to safety. White must try to create something fast, as if Black gets
one more developing move he has a perfectly fine posistion with the bishop pair. }

activity - I would say enough counterplay for being OK. Still White needs to spend some tempi to bring the b1-knight to life. Black should be happy about the outcome of the opening! }

1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6
{ Magnus once again sticks with his Sveshnikov/Rossolimo repertoire, though
he really got away with one today. It will be interesting to see if he
decides to keep going with it even though his positions out of the opening are getting more and more dangerous. }
3.d4
{ Caruana enters the mainline. With the Sveshnikov being implied very
heavily in game 1, his team has had a lot of time to come up with ideas. } ( 
3.Bb5
{ Was Caruana's choice in his first 3 white games. I think he took the
right choice to go into the riskier open Sicilian mainlines, as his best
chance to win the match is in regulation. I also think the positions suit his style better than Magnus's style. }

{ I always felt running the a-pawn the most critical try in pawn structures
like this one. More often than not it comes from a Najdorf with Be3 and an
early Nd5, but White will definitely appreciate leaving the c-pawn at home in certain positions. }
9...Be7 10.Be2 O-O 11.O-O Nd7
{ This position is not nearly as common as the Sveshnikov mainlines, but
it's still reasonably well known and there have been plenty of games
played. Caruana's next move was the one that got Magnus thinking. } 12.Bd2 $5
{ A rare choice, but a very logical move. White prioritizes developing his
pieces- what could be more natural. In a lot of cases, White will play f4,
and the bishop will stand well on c3 to pressure Black's center. This certainly turned out to be the case during the game. }
( 12.Kh1
{ For better or for worse, this has been the most common move in the past.
It doesn't make much sense to me. I can't imagine avoiding Qb6 coming with
check is worth a tempo. Caruana's move looks much stronger. } ) 12...f5 (

White from playing a5. First he can push the knight back, and then after }
13.Na3 a5 $5
{ The position doesn't seem so bad to me. The machines like White but I
don't see a great plan and Black's pieces have good squares to go to. It
has to be said that this is one of the positions where it is very clear that remaining flexible with the c-pawn was in White's favor, as if the
pawn were on c4, he would have no good way to open the queenside or deal with a knight sitting on c5 for the rest of the game. A sample line could go }

but the machine disagrees. } ) 15.Nc4 ( 15.c3 Bf6 ) 15...Bf6

would be interesting to know what Caruana had in mind had Magnus tried
a6-a5. } ) 13.a5 a6
{ Not a bad move I guess, but it looks wrong to me. The knight is not
particularly good on b5 and likely would want to reroute to a3 and c4
anyway, and Magnus now forces this to happen with a loss of tempo and weakens the b6-square at the same time. Magnus's idea was to play e4
without allowing Nd4, but still, I dislike the move. } ( 13...f4 $5
{ It makes a lot of sense to prevent White from playing f2-f4 to contest
the center and the kingside. The position is locked and Black looks like he
should have decent attacking chances, for instance after } 14.Bb4 Nf6 15.c4
a6 16.Nc3 Bf5
{ The machines like White but g5-g4 is a real plan. Black is not without
counterplay } ) 14.Na3 e4 15.Nc4 Ne5

seems unpleasant for Black. } 16.Nb6 $1
{ Caruana was still in preparation and playing very quickly. } ( 16.Nxe5 $2

16...Rb8 17.f4 $1 { Black must not be allowed to play f4 himself } 17...exf3
18.Bxf3 g5 $2
{ This was asking too much. White is breaking through on the queenside too
fast to expect the kingside attack to work. } ( 18...Bf6
{ A solid move like this one looks fine to me. } 19.c3 Nd7 $1 20.Be3 Be5 $1
{ Black's pieces have found good squares. The machine slightly prefers
White but I don't think Black has much to worry about. } ) 19.c4 $1
{ Bc3 followed by c5 is a very easy plan to execute. The loose position of
the e5 knight means White will not even need to defend the c5 pawn to get
the advance through, and if Nxf3 ever comes, Black may well regret advancing g7-g5 with the open long diagonal. Black is in big trouble. }
19...f4 20.Bc3 $1
{ Another strong move. Apparently Sesse was claiming that White is
absolutely winning here- this is far too optimistic an assessment in human
play, there is a lot of potential counterplay to contain, much like one sees in a mainline King's Indian. But his position is definitely very
promising. } 20...Bf5 $1
{ Magnus chooses the combattive move. He understood his position was
"dangerous" though I would go a step further and just call it "bad". But he
handled it absolutely the way he needed to- in a combattive manner looking for counterplay, as is the general plan in the Sveshnikov. }
( 20...Qc7 $2
{ Trying to prevent c5 is only a temporary fix. Black has a lost position
on the queenside as c5 will eventually win the game. He needs to look for
kingside counterplay. } 21.b4 Bf6 22.Rc1
{ White should be winning. Even a simple plan like Bxe5 followed by Nxc8
leaves Black unable to get g5-g4 through or make any kind of counterplay
while c5-c6 comes very fast. } ) 21.c5
{ Caruana found the best move. His position is close to winning
technically, it's more his kind of game, and he had a huge time advantage.
This was his first real chance to score a full point after only missing a completely impossible line in game 6, and he did not manage to
come through. If he loses the match, he will likely look at this game as the turning point. }
21...Nxf3+ 22.Qxf3 dxc5 23.Rad1 Bd6 24.h3 $4
{ I wavered between offering this move one question mark and two,
eventually settling on the harsher evaluation, even though I normally only
offer it for a move that squanders a full point rather than a half point. Time is absolutely of the essence. White is a pawn down and facing
the bishop pair with an imbalanced structure. His position is strong, but he absolutely needed to look for the most direct moves. Magnus is now instantly fine after one slow move that was not at all in the spirit of the position, and he even said so himself after the game. }
( 24.Nc4 $1
{ Of course this move needed to be played. The idea is totally obvious and
White did play it on the next move, only he needed to do so faster. Black
cannot allow d5-d6 to come through so eventually his dark squared bishop will be exchanged, and then the attack is decisive. }
24...g4
{ Undoubtedly Caruana was worried about this move, otherwise h3 would
really be inexplicable. But White is faster. } ( 24...Qd7

But today was the only game thus far where he absolutely had it within his power to come home with a full point. Magnus does not give many people
chances like this, and he might not give another one. Still, while Caruana can't be feeling too happy (or confident) that he missed his opportunity today, he is clearly outpreparing Magnus every game with both colors for several games in a row. If Magnus loses the match, I suspect it will be
due to another opening mishap. I'm sure he notices this trend himself and I expect him to switch things up a bit in the final four games. }

{ While the Women’s World Championship Cycle is going to imitate the
overall World Championship, it might also hold the other way around. After
eight rounds, there remained four games and an eventual tie-break to be played to determine the winner. The finale of the Women’s World
Championship looks quite similar in this respect, doesn’t it? The match has been quite tense, both players have been fighting hard and it is therefore surprising that all the games finished in draws. This shows high class of both players as well as their superb defensive abilities.
Moreover, the permanent progress of the opening theory makes it increasingly difficult to achieve an advantage with White against a well-prepared opponent. We all have probably hoped to see more decisive games, but it is really very hard to beat a 2800-rated player. }

seemingly unambitious variation with few long forced lines gives him decent

{ White has achieved a small but stable advantage. His king is safer and
his bishop is more active than its counterpart. He should keep the queens
on the board to maintain attacking chances. Magnus Carlsen has already won many equal-looking positions with rooks and opposite-coloured bishops on
the board. On the other hand, Black's position is quite solid and the drawing margin is quite broad unless White launches a mating attack. Black can sometimes sacrifice a pawn to exchange the major pieces and achieve a drawish bishop endgame. }

the World Cup 2005 semifinal, where Black gave up in a similar position without his c-pawn and with White's bishop on h3 and pawn on f5. It looks

with that decision as White can't make any progress without exchanging
pawns on the kingside, but then there's really not enough pawns remaining as it is well known for a few centuries! In any case we got a very
interesting game today in spite of a peaceful result once again, and I felt like both players took some risky or principled decisions on purpose, which means they're not waiting for what looks like a probable tiebreak. So I wouldn't dismiss the possibility of a decisive result kicking in in
the last two games. Also, the quality of the games seems very high to me in general especially considering they've been at it for almost three weeks now. }

{ The 10th game of the World Championship match was the most back and forth
affair of any game thus far. There were plenty of games where one side did
not make the most of their chances, but this has been the only one where I thought both players at some point had very real winning chances. }
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6
{ Magnus stays true to his Rossolimo/Sveshnikov repertoire for the 5th time
in a row. Starting from game 5, I have expected him to pivot every single
game, and been wrong every single time. Perhaps he will just play this the whole way through? }
3.d4 { Caruana eschews Bb5, which he chose in his first 3 White games. }
3...cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5 6.Ndb5 d6 7.Nd5
{ I was a bit surprised to see Caruana enter the same line as game 8. Even
though he got an excellent position in that game, he had to figure Magnus
would have come with improvements, and the line is supposed to be okay for Black. }

10.Be2 O-O 11.O-O Nd7 12.b4 $5
{ The first major deviation. Caruana chose Bd2 in the previous game. Still,
the move does not look too impressive to me. } ( 12.Bd2
{ Carlsen misplayed the position and quickly ended up worse. } ) 12...a6
13.Na3 a5 $5
{ A very commital decision, but not a bad one. Magnus forces the queenside
open right away, a fearless decision against a prepared opponent, but he
had other options. } ( 13...b6
{ Appeals the most to me. Black tries to keep the queenside closed and will
look for his own counterplay with f7-f5. In fact, I actually prefer Black
in a practical game here. } ) 14.bxa5 Rxa5 15.Nc4 Ra8 16.Be3
{ Caruana was still playing very fast. He probably was in his preparation.
} 16...f5 $1

game 8, here White cannot comfortabll play f2-f4 himself to keep his
kingside secure. } 17.a5 ( 17.f4 { Black is absolutely fine after } 17...exf4

18.Bb6 Qe8
{ The battle lines are drawn. White clearly has an edge on the queenside,
Black's pieces (particularly the c8-bishop and d7-knight) look a little
clumsy, and the b6 square could prove to be a problem. But Black's kingside pawn mass promises him decent counterplay. }
19.Ra3
{ A not so mysterious rook move. It looks pointless now but Black's plan is
clearly to launch a kingside attack, and the rook will be a good defender
laterally along the third rank. } ( 19.Re1
{ This is the computer's recommendation by a wide margin, but I don't
really understand the move? I guess it just serves as some vague
prophylaxis against e5-e4. It claims white is better but I am unconvinced because after }
19...Rf6 $1 { Black is ready to challenge the b6-bishop via Be7-d8. } )
19...Qg6 20.Bc7 e4 $1
{ Carlsen is in burn the bridges mode. His pawns are vulnerable and could
quickly fall if the center were to open at an inopportune moment, but he is
looking for direct counterplay against White's king, truly in the style of the Sveshnikov. }
( 20...Ra6
{ A quiet defensive move like this one was surely fine, but I think the
World Champion was right to go for it. } ) ( 20...b5 $5
{ It was also possible to play in the same manner as the game, only without
committing to e5-e4. This could make some sense as the central pawns proved
weak. } 21.Nb6 ( 21.axb6 $2
{ It's possible this move annoyed Magnus since e5-e4 no longer works, but
it is also insufficient. } 21...Rxa3 22.Nxa3
{ The problem is here Black needs a new attacking plan since e5-e4 fails to
bring its desired returns. } 22...Nc5 $1
{ The b-pawn is well under control, and most importantly, White's pieces
are totally unprepared to defend his king. How will the c7-bishop ever
contribute to a proper defense? Rf6-h6 is coming and Black should win. } ( 
22...e4 23.Bh5 $1 Qg5 24.Qg4 $1
{ White is doing well. Getting his queen to g4 will really lesse any
attacking chances Black can hope for } ) ) 21...Nxb6 22.Bxb6
{ This leads to a similar position to the game, but Black does not need to
play e5-e4 if he so desires. For instance, he seems to have a good position
after } 22...b4 23.Rb3 Bf5 $1
{ When it is clear there are reasons the pawn is good on e5 as well. } )
21.Kh1 b5 $5 { A very commital move, but not a bad one. } ( 21...Qh6
{ The machines prefer a slower buildup with something like this. Black
certainly will have attacking chances by lifting the f8-rook, but I don't
mind Magnus's decision either. } ) 22.Nb6 $1 ( 22.axb6 $2
{ This would be asking for trouble. I find it unlikely White will survive
after the energetic } 22...Rxa3 23.Nxa3 f3 $1 24.gxf3 Ne5 $1
{ Black's attack looks devastating. } ) 22...Nxb6 23.Bxb6 Qg5 $6
{ Technically, this move loses the game against best play, but it comes
with a very nasty idea of playing Rf6-h6 and delivering mate on the h-file.
A machine with its nerves of steel would have no trouble grabbing h5, but for a human, it looks absurdly dangerous. }
24.g3
{ Caruana's move makes a lot of sense. Taking on f4 and bringing the rook
to g3 should dispel any mating dreams. } ( 24.Bxb5 $1
{ White could have gotten away with this. } 24...Rf6

f1 for the bishop. } 25...Bf5 ( 25...Rh6 26.Rxe4 ) ( 25...Rg6 26.Bf1 Bf5 (

seeing all of this. } ) 26.f3 $1 e3 27.a6 Rh6 28.Re2 $3
{ An incredibly difficult only move that would have to have been prepared
in advance. White is ready to play Qg1 and hold the position together. Even
then, the variation continues. } 28...Qh5 29.Qg1 Bh4 30.g4 $1 fxg3 31.Raxe3
$1

capability. } ) 24...b4 25.Rb3 ( 25.gxf4

and this probably is an easier route to equality. Still, while Caruana's
choice gives him some only moves to find, he did find the moves and he objectively was not worse. }

Bf6 $1 { Moves like Bc3 or Be5 could come next. White is in trouble. } )
26...f3
{ White is under a lot of pressure. Around here I thought Caruana might
crack and give Magnus the first decisive result, but he defended very well.
} 27.Bf1 $1
{ This is a tough move. I would have been tempted to just let the bishop
stay on h3, since White can always sacrifice an exchange on g2 very happily
and otherwise it's not clear what active role the bishop plays. But it was absolutely critical to play Bf1. }
( 27.Bb5 $2 { A move like this looks sensible... } 27...Rf6 $1
{ Until you realize White will simply be mated on the h-file! Rh6 and Qh5
is coming, and there is nothing to be done. } ) 27...Bxf1 $1 ( 27...Qh5
{ Caveman play does not work here since White is in better shape to keep
the h-file under control. The queen coming to f1 is very important, for
instance after } 28.Rxb4 Rf6 29.Bxh3 Qxh3 30.Be3 $1
{ Black will not get Rh6 very easily, and e4 is hanging to boot. White
should win. } ) 28.Qxf1 $1
{ Another important decision. White cannot allow a disaster on the h-file.
His position looks awful with the queen and the rook so passively placed
and the d5-pawn falling, but he remains solid and can rely on the a5-pawn for counterplay. }
( 28.Rxf1 $2 { Keeping active pieces comes at a heavy price. After } 28...Qg4
$1 29.Rxb4 Rf5 $1 { White will promptly be mated by Rh5 and Qh3. } )

than Black. He managed without a ton of trouble. } 30...Bd8 31.Qe1 $1
{ The queen returns to life. } 31...Bxb6 32.axb6 Rab8 33.Qe3 Qc4 34.Rb2 Rb7

{ Setting a devilish trap, though it is not enough to claim an advantage. }

{ Far from the only holding move, but I am awarding an exclamation point
for not falling for Black's idea. } ( 36.Qb3+ $2 Kh8 37.c4
{ Looks like it traps Black's queen. But the nasty response } 37...Rxb6
$1 $19 { Would promptly turn the tables! } ) 36...Qxe3 37.Rxe3 d5
{ The position is balanced as neither side can easily mobilize their pawn
majority. Black's center looks impressive, but he can't do anything with it
so long as he is left with a passive rook on b7. } 38.h4 Rc8 39.Ra3 Kf7
40.Kh2 Ke6 41.g4 Rc6 42.Ra6 Ke5 43.Kg3 h6 44.h5

anything. Magnus tried to make something happen with } 44...Kd4 $2
{ But only made trouble for himself after the strong response } 45.Rb5 $1
{ When Black has to be somewhat accurate to not get into trouble. Still, he
has more than one route to a draw, and Magnus found a very easy one. }
45...Rd6 $1
{ Overprotecting the d5-pawn White was planning to harass with Raa5. }
46.Ra4+ Ke5 47.Rab4 Ke6
{ Nice and easy. White has no good way to challenge Black's central pawn
mass without allowing liquidation. } 48.c4 dxc4 49.Rxc4 Rdxb6 50.Rxe4+ Kf7
51.Rf5+ Rf6
{ Black loses a pawn but simplifies into an easily drawn 3 vs 2 on the
kingside. Caruana did not even bother trying. His winning chances are
approximately zero. } 52.Rxf6+ Kxf6 53.Kxf3 Kf7 54.Kg3
{ With only 2 games to go, each player has only one game to try with White.
Carlsen gets to go first, and I'll be interested to see what first move he
chooses, as well as if we will see a 6th 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian in the final game. }

he is so hard to prepare for. } 1...e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.Nc3

Caruana's Chessbase files in the leaked video! } ( 9...c6

I'm sure Magnus had some idea in mind. } ) 10.Bd3
{ Up until here Magnus was blitzing, but he started to think more after
Black's next move. This I do not really understand... } 10...c5
{ This is Black's most common move by far, and the top choice of the
machine. I don't see how Magnus could have been prepared up to Bd3 and
surprised when Black plays the best move according to both human and silicon practice. }
11.Rhe1 Be6 12.Kb1 ( 12.Bg5

in practice it has fared well, including a fine win by Karjakin over
Harikrishna. It must be the most challenging move, though obviously one has to believe Caruana would have been prepared for it. }

{ This is very forcing, extremely direct, and basically just a draw. Black
is in horrible shape if he doesn't play the most forcing moves at his
disposal. Given this is Caruana's normal M.O. anyway, I can't imagine Magnus expected to get much. }
( 15.h3
{ A patient move like this one was certainly a better try. White might go
for Nh4 in the future now than Ng4 becomes less enticing, and g2-g4 is a
plan as well. The computer even offers White a slight edge, but it's hard to imagine a 2800 losing with Black. }

though. } ) 26.Kxd2 a6 27.a3 Kf8

and have an easy fortress. } 28.Bc7 b5 29.Bd6+ Ke8 30.Bxc5 h5

hoping Santa Claus will bring you Christmas presents. Once you reach a
certain level, you know it will never happen. } ( 55.fxg6 fxg6

a second passed pawn. } ) 55...Bc2

Carlsen with only three minutes less. There wasn't much to say, and if I
thought Chess. com would pay me my standard ! million per game fee for leaving my annotations blank, maybe I would have done it! Game 12 should
be interesting. The high pressure might induce more mistakes than normal and we could see more of a fight. One wonders if Carlsen will stick with the Sveshnikov for a sixth game in a row. Caruana is very likely to keep playing 1. e4. }

has cleared the b4-square for White's queen! This makes his task significantly harder, if not impossible. In addition, the pawn on a4 deprives Black's knight and bishop access to this square, which both pieces would want to use. Magnus said this was prophylaxis against Bd4 due to Nb3, but it
still doesn't come close to justifying allowing the queen to b4. } (

{ Magnus has gotten a lot of grief for offering a draw here, from both club
level online kibitzers to past World Champions. I'll spare him my full
thoughts on the matter, but I will say I don't really understand his decision. He faces absolutely no risk ever and still has some plans at his
disposal to try to get b5 through, with as Bd7, Rrb8, etc. Maybe White is holding, maybe he isn't. I'd need to look a lot longer to draw any conclusions. But I really think Black should have played, at least until time control. All that said, I still think he is a favorite in the playoff. His
rapid and blitz skills have long been atop the world, and I do think he played better overall chess in the classical portion (if this can ever be said for a 6-6 tie with no decisive games). Still, while he is a favorite in the playoff, his victory is by no means gauranteed. Upsets can happen, and Magnus would do well to try not to be tilted by both starting and ending the match by drawing a winning position with Black. }
