{When one is looking through studies in endgame books or databases, one will
just take the sources as a given. From a historical point of view, they can be
far from that. If Grigoriev wasn't the Isvestia editor, would this newspaper
have had as lively a studies column?     White is to move and win in this pawn
endgame. White has five moves to the promotion square, Black also has five
moves but wins a tempo by giving a check on b3 if the pawns just run. White
wins the tempo back, giving check on g8, but after 6.-Ka1 only has a draw. But
what else should happen? Certainly, if b3 happens without a check, White wins
as Black won't promote, owing to White giving check on g8. But that is a dream
only, an impossible task... or not?} 1. Kc3 $1 {It is the knig, not the pawn,

{Rinck in Deutsche Schachblätter 1908 originally had the black rook on c1,
making the study unsolvable, as proven by Fila in Ceskoslovensky Sach 1955.
This means the solution, and starting with 2.-Rc3 also the position, is
identical with Rinck 1908. I don't know why the judges thought of it so high
as to give a 4th prize - either Grigoriev also found the refutation of Rinck's
study, or the judges didn't know this predecessor. I believe the former, but
can't prove it. However, I don't see why Grigoriev would have published this
otherwise, as he was knowing Rinck's study. - Readers will understand that
this is not a representation of Grigoriev's work, but rather something they
can possibly use in one of their own endgames. Capablanca once said he studied
over one thousand rook endgames(!) prior to heading into the tournament arena.
While this number seems exaggerated, the underlying message certainly is not -
knowledge of rook endgames is important. Visiting Belgrade after the death of
my friend Milan, I wanted a personal item of him, and have received the Keres
book "Praktische Endspiele" in the Rattmann edition 1973 (in English, the book
was published unter the title "Practical Chess Endings"). I read through this
book, and indeed it contains endgames from practical play, and there are also
quite some rook endgames, showing the importance of studying not only
artificial compositions but also such from actual games. Nevertheless, the
reader is invited to study this endgame here. - White is to move and draw.} 1. Rf5 $3 {Very precise, and the only move to draw!} ({The first move can only be

Shakhmaty v SSSR 1938 demonstrates also the level of aesthetics that is

the well understanding of the theory of opposition by Grigoriev. The source
given as "Tvorchestvo Grigorieva" - translated "The creative activity of

"Shakhmatnaye Tvorchestvo Grigorieva" as compiled by Konstantinopolsky (first
edition) is meant. A second edition, compiled by Bondarevsky, was published in
1954 at Moscow's "Fizkultura i Sport" (book publishing information taken from

is to move and win once more.} 1. Kf2 $1 Kf7 2. Ke3 $1 Ke6 {The study is not
