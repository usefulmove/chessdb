{Mikhail Tal, the 'magician from Riga,' was the greatest attacking World
Champion of them all, and this enchanting autobiography chronicles his
extraordinary career with charm and humour. Dazzling games are interspersed
throughout with anecdotes and witty self-interviews, and in typically
objective fashion he related both the downs and ups of his encounters. An
inveterate smoker and drinker, Tal's life on the circuit was punctuated by
bouts in the hospital with kidney problems, but nothing could dull his love
for chess and his sheer genius on the chessboard. His illustrious tournament
record, up to his death in 1992, is included here in full, along with 100
complete games and nearly as many positions. Tal's annotations in this book
are a world apart from ordinary games collections. No reader could fail to be
swept along by his passion and vitality as he sets the scene for an encounter
and then recounts every psychological twist and turn.} 1. -- {The legendary
Mikhail Tal was the finest ever exponent of attacking chess. His all-out
sacrificial style took him all the way to the World Championship title. Dogged
by ill-health, Tal's reign was a short one, and he was never able to regain
his crown, but Tal remained an outstanding player right up to his death in
1992. His departure has taken away one of the chess world's most charismatic
figures; a player who excited chess passions wherever he went.} *

{Mikhail Tal was a remarkable man. His brilliant successes in the years
leading up to his World Championship victory excited the chess world; his very
name became synonymous with brilliance and attacking flair. 'Misha' had a warm
and engaging personality without a hint of malice. His enthusiasm for the game
he loved was unquenchable. In his later years he was afflicted by severe
health problems which would have crushed a lesser man, but he never complained
about his difficulties and continued to play chess right up to his death.
Misha hated to postpone a game; even if he had to slip out of his doctors'
grasp, he would try to make it somehow. Despite his fragile appearance, his
attacking powers and astonishingly quick sight of the board remained intact.
--- My last visit to him was in May 1992, just after he had returned from
Barcelona, his last major tournament. He 'showed' me his fine win against
Lautier, but was so weak that he had to lie on his back and dictate the moves
and analysis 'blindfold' to me, while I played them over on a board. He died
on 28th June 1992, and the chess world is a much poorer place for his absence.
} 1. -- {I was delighted to be asked by Cadogan Books to work on a new edition
of his classic book The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal, which covers his career
up to 1975. This is one of those rare chess books which is not only splendidly
instructive, but also conveys a real impression of the author's personality.
--- There was relatively little for me to do apart from convert the moves to
algebraic notation. I corrected some obvious misprints and errors (the
incorrect diagram for the game fragment on page 61 and the missed mate in one
in the analysis of game 90 are typical examples). In some cases there were
errors caused by misprints, for instance the accidental omission of moves. I
have corrected these without comment (just as an example, I have mentioned one
as a footnote on page 150). Likewise, in about 20 academic cases, I have
tidied up the end of a variation. I do not doubt that Tal would have agreed to
these changes had he still been alive to go over the proofs. If there was any
doubt about the analysis, or if the change was in any way significant, my
remark appears as a footnote. --- To avoid confusion, I should explain that
footnotes which are marked 'Editor's note' and 'Translator's note' are
transcribed from the RHM edition. The unattributed footnotes are mine and
appear for the first time in this edition.} (1. -- {John Nunn, Chertsey, June

{The chess world owes Cadogan Books plc a debt of gratitude for undertaking
the monumental task of bringing this classic work by Mikhail Tal back into
print. Since being first published in 1976 by RHM, and never reprinted due to
the subsequent collapse of the publisher, a whole generation has grown up who
have never even seen a copy. Yet The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal is quite
probably the greatest chess book ever written. I am sure that everybody
involved in the initial edition will be delighted that Tal's masterpiece is
once again available to lovers of chess world-wide. --- In this respect we
must thank David Levy (the original editor), and everyone else involved in
RHM's pioneering original edition. All of the game annotations are by Tal
himself, except for games 8, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 23 and 29 (done jointly
by Tal and Koblents, his Latvian trainer) and games 87, 88 and 92 (done
jointly by Tal and Kirilov).} 1. -- {For this marvellous new algebraic version,
Grandmaster John Nunn spent weeks transcribing the material from descriptive
notation, checking the text and deciphering unintelligible variations. Ken
Neat (who did so much fine translation work on the original version) has
retranslated games 33 and 34 from Russian especially for this edition, and has
also fully updated Tal's tournament and match record.} (1. -- {Murray Chandler,

{Dialogue between a chess player and a journalist - (instead of an
autobiography)} 1. -- {Dramatis personae: A CHESS PLAYER. Mikhail Tal --- A
JOURNALIST. Who knows, perhaps alias ...} (1. -- {JOURNALIST. Well now, 'Shall
we begin?'. Did you think, on first sitting down at the chessboard, that you
would at some time playa match for the World Championship? Incidentally, what
do you recall of your first game? --- CHESS PLAYER. Did I think... Probably
not. Matches for the World Championship are fairly rare events, and from the
physical point of view it is simply not possible for many chess fans to take
part in them. I say fans, because, after all, even professionals are chess
fans. --- But about my first game. When one of us first plays chess, he is
like a man who has already caught a dose of microbes of, say, Hong Kong' flu.
Such a man walks along the street, and he does not yet know that he is ill. He
is healthy, he feels fine, but the microbes are doing their work. ---
Something similar, though less harmful, occurs in chess. You have just been
shown that the knight moves like the Russian letter _|_, the bishop diagonally,
the castle (note, the castle, not the rook) in a straight line, while the
queen (once again not the fyerzl [Translator's note: 'Fyerz', derived from
Indian, is the special Russian chess term for the queen.], but the queen!) -
likes her own colour. You lose the first game. But at some time, if your
father or elder brother or simply an old friend wants to be kind to you, then
you win, and as a result feel very proud of yourself. A few days pass, and
suddenly you involuntarily begin to sense that, without chess, there is
something missing in your life. Then you may rejoice: you belong to that group
of people without a natural immunity to the chess disease... --- This is the
way we all begin. And then - the same road; for some it is smooth, for others
less so. But when you sit down to play a match for the World Championship,
then sometimes you recall that first game. --- I lost my first serious game.
To my cousin. And when, for the first time in my life, I fell into 'scholar's
mate', it was a real tragedy, because at that time I considered myself to be
an experienced player. The fact is that my elders were extremely kind, and
while learning I had many more 'victories' to my credit than defeats. --- And
then this tragedy. The first in the whole of my 10 years... --- Then, for
some completely different reason - it seems that I wanted to join a drama
group - I entered the Riga Palace of Pioneers. In the corridor I suddenly
noticed a sign on one of the doors: 'Chess Section'. Excellent!, I thought.
I'll go in and say to the man who is helping the others that my feelings have
been hurt, and he will teach me and show me how to win. --- I went in. I
wasn't shown anything straight away, but I stayed. I stayed, and became
fascinated, perhaps because I was very fortunate with my first chess teacher.
His name, Yanis Kruzkop, will not be familiar to many chess players. But he
has done a great deal for chess, since in all his pupils he has implanted, to
put it stylistically, a whole-hearted love for the game. --- After a few
months of lessons I began winning against my elder brother. But - what a
terrible thing - in doing so I did not feel any particular satisfaction, for I
saw that he was not playing well. The time had come to seek stronger opponents
...}) (1. -- {JOURNALIST. Would you recall for us, please, all your first
games; the first in a tournament, the first against a master; the first to
appear in print. --- CHESS PLAYER. Of course I first played against a master
in a simultaneous display. The young master Ratmir Kholmov, who had just made
a very successful appearance in the 1947 International Chigorin Memorial
Tournament, came to Riga, and therefore we were all highly intrigued. I won in,
as it then seemed to me, combinative style (see the following game).}) *

{My first serious tournament was the Riga Youth Championship. At that time I
had a fourth category rating, obtained at the Pioneers' Palace. It was a
pretty low rating, but according to some unofficial data I was considered to
be a promising player, and was allowed into the Championship. --- I started
very well: three out of three. But then for the first, and, unfortunately, not
the last time, I had to go directly from the tournament to hospital on account
of scarlet fever. And on the same day that this occurred, a mass match over
100 boards was held in Riga between adults and young players. I played
somewhere around board 45, and an indication of the way I was feeling can be
gained from the fact that I was mated as White in about 8 moves. Incidentally,
it was one of my three starting wins which first appeared in print, in the
All-Union youth magazine Zatyeynik.} 19. Rf6 $1 {(A blockading sacrifice, by

No, I didn't - but I was very pleased with it!} (25. -- {JOURNALIST. And had
you reached the level where you would dream about games or adjourned
positions? --- CHESS PLAYER. This happened to me even a little earlier, in
1947, and turned out excellently! In one of the innumerable tournaments at the
Pioneers' Palace I adjourned a game against Krapivner, a second category
player, in what I then considered to be a hopeless position. That evening I
tried everything I could in the position, for the resumption was the following
morning. I could find nothing, and so I decided that I would go in and resign.
But during the night I dreamed about some unintelligible idea connected - I
remember this clearly - with the adjourned game. On resumption I thought for
some 10 minutes, and found it! --- But then, unfortunately, I dropped below
'that level', and never again in my life have I dreamed about an adjourned
game. --- Then, by-passing the third category, I succeeded in gaining the
second category rating in my next tournament, and I now began to take a real
interest in chess. And if we are still talking about 'firsts', then I must
recall my first departure from Riga to the 'International', as we then proudly
considered it, Tournament of Pioneers' Palaces of the three Baltic Republics.
We had to travel to Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. --- Our team was the
youngest there. I, for instance, was only 12 years old. And in my first game
against the Estonians my opponent was a very adult-looking 16-17 year old.
Evidently the Estonian players had come only to win, which would explain the
fact that their team was not altogether made up of Pioneers. And it was not at
all surprising that the Riga team took last place, while on second board I
scored only one point out of four. But it was this point that proved decisive,
since I won against the Estonian player, and as a result the home team took
first place. Probably because of this, for the first time in my life, I was
awarded the prize for the most interesting game of the event, although I was
highly sceptical about my creative success. The prize - a luxurious edition of
Aleksei Tolstoy's book Peter the First - was very fine, but terribly heavy.
And when it was presented to me, it seemed only slightly easier to drag it
back to the table where our team was sitting, than it had been to win the
award-winning game... --- In the next year, 1949, I took part in official
All-Union events for the first time, when I played for the Latvian youth team
in the Championship of the Soviet Union. Incidentally, during the six years
that my age allowed me to take part in youth events, I progressed from the
last to the first board in our team. In my first game - it was in the match
with Byelorussia - I won, but this success proved to be my only one. I recall
a curious encounter from the tournament with the Lithuanian candidate master
Mendeleevsky, which at one point shook my youthful belief in the
irreproachability of the elite. --- The point is that a year earlier in the
Match-Tournament for the World Championship, Botvinnik had sacrificed a pawn
in the Slav Defence, and had won very nicely against Euwe. At that time I
frequently played this opening, and during the game I established the fact
that Mendeleevsky and I were conscientiously following the steps of Botvinnik
and Euwe. In addition, I recalled very well that the theorists had condemned
the pawn capture, and had recommended another move instead. In particular,
Botvinnik had stated this in his notes to the game. And at the board I thought
for a very long time, trying to disprove Botvinnik, because I thought to
myself: surely Euwe, such an expert on theory, couldn't have made a mistake.
In the end, 'boldly' following the Dutch Ex-World Champion, I also obtained a
lost position, and lengthy thought led to my first loss on time and, thank God,
this was the only one in all my years of chess.}) (25. -- {JOURNALIST. Does
this mean that your 'single combat' with the World Champion began at this
point? Or should account be taken of the summer of 1948, when you set off with
a chessboard to play against Botvinnik, who had arrived on holiday? --- CHESS
PLAYER. This story is widely known, and I always smile, however many times I
hear it. But it is evidently time to explain that it is merely a story. It is
true that Botvinnik, after winning the World Championship, took a holiday by
the sea at Riga. I knew about this and wanted to play against him, but there
the truth ends. When I told my family of my intentions they gently dissuaded
me from issuing a challenge to the World Champion. But then your journalistic
colleagues heard about it, and immediately 'placed' a chessboard under my arm,
sent me off to play Botvinnik, and - how can there be any intrigue without
women! - introduced into the act a woman, who barred my way at the World
Champion's door. --- In the following Youth Championship of the country I was
already playing on a higher board for Latvia, and on this occasion I was
taught an instructive lesson. We had to play a preliminary match with our
contemporaries from the Russian Federation, for which we travelled to
Yaroslavl. My opponent was a strong player, the very likeable Victor
Golenishev, a future master. Our first game progressed with changing fortunes,
and was adjourned in an ending slightly inferior for me. But analysis
disclosed that I could obtain by force a position with a knight against two
bishops, and nothing else on the board. --- Only relatively recently, eighteen
months to two years previously, had I learned to give mate to a lone king with
two bishops, and, naturally, did not suspect that, having a knight, I would
face any difficulties. Therefore, when this position was reached, I began
trying to catch my opponent's eye, expecting an offer of a draw. But play went
on, and still no offer, and after 10-12 moves I began to sense that it was not
at all so simple. In the end I lost the game, and only managed to gain my
revenge 11 years later in my second match with Botvinnik, when I won a similar
ending (Translator's note: 17th Match game, 1961.). --- A striking example of
the benefit of youth tournaments! --- On that occasion, in Yaroslavl, we did
not reach the final. But in the following year, as a result of a very
interesting trip to Kishinyev - I had never before been so far away from home,
and people looked at us as foreigners - we reached the final, since we
defeated the Moldavian lads. There I played what was evidently the first
successful ending in my life. Everyone thought that the bishop ending where I
was a pawn up would be a draw, but we managed to find an interesting bishop
manoeuvre which gave White a forced win.}) 1-0

playing on board four, and enjoyed at that time the reputation of a
hussar-like tactician, always ready to sacrifice something. But here, taking
into account the team's interests, our captain advised me to play quietly and
reservedly. The results were immediately apparent! In the very first round,
playing White in a well-known variation of the Caro-Kann Defence, I sacrificed
a pawn according to theory - I considered that I had the right to do this -
but then the normal continuation of the attack was to sacrifice two further
pawns, and, in some cases, a rook. Bearing in mind what my captain had said, I
began looking for a peaceful solution to the position, got into time-trouble
and lost. This happened every time that I attempted to play reservedly and
accurately. It was only when my opponents themselves thrust wild complications
upon me, and I could not avoid them, that I was successful. --- Besides, I
already considered myself to be quite an experienced player. At the end of
1950 I had made my debut in the adult Championship of Riga. In the quarter-
final I scored 12½ out of 13, and reached the first category norm, then
from the semi-final I went through to the final. I finished the Championship
with 9 points out of 19, somewhere in the region of 11th-14th places. However,
it was something else that was rather curious. --- There were two masters
playing in the final - Alexander Koblents from Riga, my future trainer, and,
hors concours, the Muscovite Evgeny Zagoryansky, together with five candidate
masters and 13 first category players. Against the masters I scored 1½
points, and was pleased with my defence of a difficult position against
Zagoryansky. My score against the candidates was 3½, but against my fellow
first category players - 4 out of 12! --- Nevertheless, I got through to the
Latvian Championship, although this was my fourth tournament in a row and
perhaps a little more attention should have been paid to my school work,
especially since the third quarter of the school year was finishing. --- The
tournament began not at all badly for me. In the first round I saved my game
against Strautmanis in a way that I liked then, and still do - I fell into a
trap, so as to then catch my opponent in it. I got into a difficult position
as Black, but then found a combination, apparently overlooking a tactical blow,
but in fact winning my opponent's queen for rook and bishop by force. The game
finished as a draw. In the second round I fairly quickly defeated the Liepaya
player Gravitis, but then in the third round came a tragedy which thoroughly
upset me. In my game against the candidate master Zhdanov I played, as I still
consider, quite well. As Black in the Marshall Attack I carried out a fairly
interesting combination. --- I allowed my opponent to obtain a second queen
with check, but when he did this, it became clear that his position was quite
hopeless; then, in an elementary won position, thinking that I could win just
as I pleased, I simply blundered away a piece. There was still a draw to be
had, but I completely went to pieces at this sudden turn of events, and lost
the game. Following this I lost several more games, practically without a
struggle, so that about six rounds from the finish I was firmly seated in one
of the bottom places. But towards the end the spring holidays began. School
gave me, as it were, time out to regain my strength, and in the remaining
games I gained some five points, so that for the second successive time I
shared 11th-14th places with 9 points out of 19.} (63. -- {JOURNALIST. Were
you thinking at this time about your chess future; not about the World
Championship title, of course, but at least of the title of master? --- CHESS
PLAYER. I'm afraid that this may now sound coquettish, but at that time I
simply played chess and gained pleasure from it.}) (63. -- {JOURNALIST. But
surely you wanted to do battle with famous players? --- CHESS PLAYER. Yes, of
course, I very much enjoyed doing so. Even at that time I was occasionally
able to do this, though only in simultaneous displays. --- My first such
encounter was with Keres, our neighbour from the north, our idol. He came to
give a simultaneous display against us, and although he was engaged at that
time in the battle for the chess crown, I considered it unethical to play
against him in a normal display. I was, after all, a finalist in the Latvian
Championship, a solid first category player. So I put my name down for a
display with clocks, which Keres gave on 10 boards. --- He suffered two
defeats - at the hands of future grandmasters Gipslis and myself. And I was
very pleased with this game, not so much because I won, but more because I
defeated Keres in the Botvinnik Variation. I thought that psychologically this
would be a terrible shock for him, since Keres and Botvinnik were always
considered to be, as it were, fundamental opponents at the chessboard. Time
passed. Paul Petrovich and I played together in tournaments for several years.
Once I asked him whether he remembered our first encounter. Yes, he replied,
in Tallinn, in the match between Latvia and Estonia. No, I told him, earlier,
in Riga, in a simultaneous display. Here Paul Petrovich admitted that he had
completely forgotten this game - and I had thought that a defeat in the
Botvinnik Variation would remain in his memory for ever... --- In the
following year, 1952, once again in the Latvian Championship, I acquired that
very nice habit, which is still with me, of losing my first game. Since this
occurred in the opening 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bd3 (??) Nf6 4 c3 where I was
playing Black, I was upset and gained a further two noughts almost straight
away. Then things turned for the better, I finished up in 7th place, and
inflicted the only defeat on the Latvian Champion Pasman. --- In the Youth
Championship of the Country our team had its usual troubles, while I was also
concerned about the problem of my further education. I finished school at the
age of fifteen and a half, since previously I had been accepted directly into
the third year. I sent my application to the Law Faculty of the University,
but they pointed out to me that I would finish University when I was 20, and
according to the law I could be a Public Assessor, or fulfil certain other
juridical functions, only from the age of 21, so after University I would have
a year of enforced idleness. Then special permission was received from the
Ministry in Moscow, from which it appeared that I had the right to study at
the Philological Faculty. I heard about this during the Youth Championships. I
loved literature and had nothing against the idea. I flew home, passed the
exam, and registered. --- Towards the end of the same year, I played for the
first time in an adult team 'Daugavi' - which took part in group two of the
USSR Championship. Incidentally, an amusing incident occurred there: I played
a game, the result of which I do not know to this day. --- It was in the final
round. I got into a bad position, but on resumption succeeded in confusing
matters, and my opponent, losing his head in time-trouble, began to repeat
moves. The repetition was somewhat veiled, but the same position occurred
three times. In accordance with the rules, I did not make my 55th move, but
called the chief controller, and asked him to record the draw. But my opponent,
in a very loud stentorian-like voice, said that I was a boy, that I had no
idea of what was meant by repetition of position, and showed the controller
his scoresheet. --- The controller took a quick glance, said that there had
been no repetition, and told us to play on. My opponent emerged from
time-trouble, then realised his advantage and won. Later I went up to the
assistant chief controller, and asked him to explain things. We quickly set up
the position, and decided that the repetition had occurred. What was I to do?
Shortly afterwards, while I was wondering whether or not to submit a protest,
the chief controller came up to me with tables in his hand, and began trying
to persuade me that the game was of no great importance' that all the same our
team would take third place, that all the same I would not win the individual
tournament on my board, so that on the whole there was no point in creating a
fuss. --- He went away, whereupon the other controllers came up and said that
the chief controller had offended them, and that I should submit a protest. So
I wrote one out, but then our train left, and therefore to this day I do not
know the control team's decision.}) (63. -- {JOURNALIST. And who was the chief
controller? --- CHESS PLAYER. Is it important? On a couple of subsequent
occasions he was the chief controller of tournaments where I was playing. And
both times, for some reason, I forgot to ask him what had been the result of
that game... --- But, to be honest, I very quickly forgot about it.
Especially since I soon gained my first real success: in the Latvian
Championship I took first place. Mind you, I couldn't avoid doing so. The
point was that from 1951, each year for a period of five years, the
Championship of the Republic was won 'according to tradition' by a first-year
student from the University. In 51 Pasman from the Faculty of History, in 52
Klyavin from Physics-Mathematics, in 54 Klovans from the Faculty of Economics,
and in 55 Gipslis, so that when in 1953 I was the only first-year in the
Championship, victory came 'of its own accord'. I played well, although I lost
to the master Koblents in a game which he remembers to this day. --- In that
game I played the opening badly, but then he missed a tactical stroke, and in
addition had very little time left on his clock, but here, in his time
pressure, I played 'a tempo', and lost my queen. With his flag raised,
Koblents made his 39th move, got up and prepared to walk away, thinking that
the control had been reached. I warned him that he was mistaken. Koblents was
most mistrustful of my words, but all the same he sat down and made another
move a few seconds before the fall of his flag, whereupon I resigned. He then
checked his scoresheet, found the mistake in it, and 'began to respect' me.
--- By the way, at that moment we two were the only real challengers for first
place, but then the Maestro, as Koblents was called by everyone, dropped back
somewhat... --- Youth as a whole did well in the tournament, so that when, in
the autumn, after the Youth Championship of the Country where I succeeded in
playing the fairly lively game against Birbrager given here, we set off for
the Adult Team Championship of the USSR, the Latvian team appeared
unexpectedly young, with 16 year-olds Tal and Gipslis, and 17 year-old Klovans.
Only our leader, Koblents, and one other player, could be called experienced
fighters. It was to Koblents that the witty Lithuanian master Vistanestskis
addressed himself - 'What are you doing? It is after 1st September, and time
for children to be at school, and you are making them play chess!' Taking into
account our previous rather poor performances, few saw us as potential
finalists. --- We played with great enthusiasm, and not only reached the final,
but even took fourth place there, ahead of the weakened, but nevertheless
formidable, Ukrainian team. On the third board Klyavin played splendidly, and
as a result gained the master title. I also reached the master norm, but the
All-Union Classification Committee considered it inexpedient to give the title
straight away to two members of the same team (and on board 2 I had gained
less points than Klyavin). Instead I was granted the right to play a
qualifying match with the then practically permanent Champion of Byelorussia,
the master Vladimir Saigin. --- From the team tournament, the game with
Korchnoi sticks in my memory; it was our first game. We played each other
twice, but it was our first encounter in the opening round of the semi-final
which so affected the score between us, which, as is well known, is not at all
in my favour. --- Before the start of play I was naturally nervous: at that
time Korchnoi was already considered to be a certain candidate for the
grandmaster title. In an Alekhine Defence I obtained the better position, then
saw a chance to increase the pressure, and a forced variation. I went in for
it and... adjourned the game with a minimal advantage for my opponent. On
resumption I defended stubbornly, but all the same resigned towards the end of
the first hundred moves. There was some consolation in the fact that in the
final Korchnoi finished below me.}) (63. -- {JOURNALIST. At that time you were
already having to play fairly important, and sometimes decisive, games. How
did you manage in them? --- CHESS PLAYER. At that time not very well,
especially in team events when I was tortured by a sense of heightened
responsibility. I tried to restrain myself, but to play 'not your own game',
to play against yourself, is always difficult and unpleasant. Later, within
eighteen months to two years, I began to succeed in decisive games, perhaps
because I realised a very simple truth: not only was I worried, but also my
opponent. --- The year 1954 began for me with my first tournament game against
a Grandmaster, none other than Keres. We travelled to Tallinn for the
traditional friendly match, in which there was normally a hard battle on the
men's boards, while on the two women's boards the ladies from Estonia always
defeated ours. For some reason I, and not Koblents, was on board one, and when
it became known that Keres would be playing, my team-mates gloomily joked that
the number of our ladies' boards had become three: boards nine, ten and one.
--- The surprises, some of them really touching, began as early as the station
in Tallinn, when among those there to meet us we saw Keres. We, who were
mainly lads, were taken in his car to the hotel, and for literally each of us
he found a friendly, welcoming smile. --- The first round was played that
evening. Our game began with the King's Indian Defence, and I remember that on
the 6th move I had a strong urge to exchange queens. However, I did not want
to play openly for a draw, and later I realised that I would have been
unlikely to gain one against such a virtuoso as Keres. --- At a later stage I
played sharply, Keres seized the initiative, and I admired the way that, in
time-trouble, he left himself literally 3-5 seconds for his last move, and,
having worked everything out, captured my piece, not fearing the series of
checks which then commenced. Of course I lost the adjourned game, but I drew
the second as Black, finding an unexpected move in a somewhat inferior ending.}
) (63. -- {JOURNALIST. But all the same, you were a candidate master, whereas
Keres was number two or three in the world. Wasn't it frightening? --- CHESS
PLAYER. No, it was very interesting.}) (63. -- {JOURNALIST. And have you never
been afraid of anyone? --- CHESS PLAYER. Before a game with Korchnoi, for
instance, or with Spassky or Keres, against whom the score is clearly not in
my favour, I might be nervous, feel uncomfortable or even afraid, but on
sitting down at the board, I would forget about everything: I would become
engrossed in the game.}) (63. -- {JOURNALIST. Did you ever head for a draw
from the very first move? --- CHESS PLAYER. In all my life, only once. In the
1955 USSR Team Championship Semi-final, playing White against Korchnoi, after
the moves 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5, I captured on d5. I was terribly ashamed, and from
that time I swore: to play for a draw, at any rate with White, is to some
degree a crime against chess. --- After the team match, the Latvian
Championship was held. I was 'physically' unable to win it, since I was now in
my second year of study, and I shared second and third places with Gipslis.
Then in the summer I played the match with Saigin. At that time, in testing us,
the Chess Federation was rather careful in its choice of examiners for those
seeking the master title. It may be recalled that, a few months before
becoming a Grandmaster and a candidate for the World Championship, Petrosian
played such a match, as did Kholmov a little later. --- My match with Saigin
proceeded in a very lively fashion. To this day the impression has not left me
that at some point the Byelorussian master simply felt sorry for me, and
played the last few games at only half strength. The first game, which was
very interesting, ended in a draw. Just at that time we were studying the
so-called Belgrade Gambit, and in the Pioneers' Palace we rehearsed the most
interesting and head-spinning variations. --- Of course, the decision to make
this opening my main weapon as White against Saigin was clearly attributable,
in the main, to the fact that I was only eighteen years old. In the second
game I was a little careless in the opening, and lost in 17 moves. I won the
third with roughly the same 'speed'. Then came a series of draws which we each
secured in turn. --- The best game of the match was the eighth, which is given
here, and which I won, but the tenth also sticks in my mind. In it the pieces
were so amusingly placed, that you might have thought that it was being played
by beginners!}) 1-0

extra rook. To my misfortune, the idea of a fantastically beautiful win came
into my head. I played for it, the situation grew tense, both kings were
threatened with mate, and suddenly I discovered that the whole point of my
combination lay in the move Bf8-g5 (!!!). Since bishops don't move that way, I
had to resign. --- It was here that I had the unsubstantiated feeling that
Saigin was not especially pleased with such a win, and that he played the next
two games as if he were feeling guilty. I managed to win them and this
terminated the match ahead of schedule, although we also played the final game.

All these attempts of yours to find more complicated wins have cost, and still
cost you, more points than perhaps anyone else in the world. Surely life must
have taught you something? --- CHESS PLAYER. Yes, it probably has. Nowadays,
in my opinion, this happens less frequently, but, you see, sometimes an idea
occurs which is so interesting that it proves stronger than me. I can recall
the game with Veltmander from the match Russian Federation-Latvia, 1955, and
that with Sveshnikov from the 1973 USSR Championship. But perhaps it is not
worth recalling them?}) (47. -- {JOURNALIST. Yes, it is! --- CHESS PLAYER.
Then concerning my game with Veltmander: he gave a last, dying check. I could
have moved my king to b2, after which mate in three was inevitable, but from
the aesthetic point of view this for some reason appeared unattractive to me.
I allowed him some play, and with difficulty gained a draw. An unpleasant
situation arose, for I was simply unable to explain to my team-mates what had
happened. True, in my heart I remained faithful to myself, and only regretted
the fact that I had miscalculated. Otherwise everything would have been fine!})
(47. -- {JOURNALIST. The second question: when you were not awarded the master
title, but it was suggested that you play a match, were you offended? ---
CHESS PLAYER. Oh, no... You see, I was so cocky that I thought that if there
was to be a match, then I would win it. --- From the other events of that year
I should like to mention the Youth Team Championship of the Country. I had by
now ascended from last to first board in the Latvian team, and here I played
for the first time against the leader of the Leningrad team, Boris Spassky.
The board one tournament was highly respectable: apart from Spassky and myself
there were future Grandmasters Gufeld and Liberzon, and International Master
Bagirov. Spassky and I had our own special race: he scored 7½ out of 9, and
I half a point less, but I succeeded in carrying out a combination, the idea
of which I found pleasing (see the following game).}) 1/2-1/2

lost more games than I won or drew. --- 1955 was notable for my debut in the

Championship, but I was somehow living in anticipation of greater things, and
regarded it as just an ordinary tournament. Besides, the first-year student

{Then came the USSR Individual Championship, not the final, of course, but
only the quarter-final. The 'quarter' in which I played was called the Baltic
Zonal Tournament, and was strong enough: the chess players from the Baltic and
Byelorussia have always been, as they say, 'in the public eye'. Four of the
eighteen competitors subsequently became Grandmasters. Incidentally, it was
there that for the first time in the All-Union arena (in the Latvian
Championship it had already happened once) I played a tournament game with a
representative of the fairer (also sometimes called the weaker) sex: the USSR
Ladies' Champion Kira Zvorikina scored one point; fortunately, it was not
against me that she won. --- From the creative point of view, the tournament
began very productively for me. Even all the draws - and in the first seven
rounds I had as many as five - were at times simply head-spinning. Then came a
decline and two highly annoying defeats, one of which occurred in the game
with Lein, due to an incident which for me was atypical. He had very little
time remaining, and, thinking over the problem of how to realise my advantage
most quickly, I forgot all about the clock. Suddenly I saw the controllers
approaching. 'What, have they never seen time-trouble?', I thought, and
accidentally glancing at the clock, noticed that my flag was about to fall,
while Lein's minutes remained intact. In some 40 seconds I succeeded in making
all 15 moves to the control, but in my haste the path I followed was not at
all the one over which I had been thinking for so long. --- Be that as it may,
but some 6 or 7 rounds before the finish my chances of success had practically
disappeared. In addition, my next three games were with my colleagues from
Riga, all of whom were above me in the tournament table. However, sport is
sport, and it was necessary to 'step over their dead bodies'. The ending with
Gipslis proved especially interesting. From the start my opponent played
openly for a draw, knowing that this would not satisfy me. What was I to do?
It would be suicide to rush into the attack against White's solid position,
and after thinking over one move for I hour 40 minutes (!!), I voluntarily
went into a difficult, perhaps even lost ending. On the other hand, the
resulting position demanded energetic action on Gipslis' part, but he was
unable to re-adjust, and Black obtained a counter-attack. In the adjourned
position I succeeded in finding a study-like win.} 18... Qe5 19. Nxf6+ gxf6 20.

{At home, in Riga, the Semi-final proved a great surprise to me. Grandmaster
Boleslavsky was playing there, as well as strong and experienced masters such
as Furman and Korchnoi. Against the latter I had a considerably inferior
individual score. Trying to 'win one back', I lost to him from a better
position on the eve of the Semi-final in the Russian Federation-Latvia Match,
and then again in the Semi-final. Up till then I had scored roughly 50%
against him as Black, but would systematically lose to him as White.
Psychology clearly played its part! --- Then, in such a strong tournament as
this, I managed to assure myself of first place with one round to go. Several

{Every experienced chess player (and I, unfortunately, have every right to be
considered one) is familiar with that strange feeling which he has when he
sits down to annotate his early games. On the one hand, he plays through them
with a sort of tenderness, just like an adult watching a film taken by his
parents of his early years or even months, or looking through the fading
photographs from a family album; on the other hand, whether he wants to or not,
on almost every move his hand all but stretches out to attach a question mark.
On the whole, I do not like annotating other people's games. The point is that
I consider that it is very difficult to penetrate into a player's thinking, to
guess the direction of the variations thought out by him, and therefore it is
better to direct one's attention towards one's own games. I prefer to make my
annotations 'hot on the heels', as it were, when the fortunes of battle, the
worries, hopes and disappointments are still sufficiently fresh in my mind.
Much as I would like to, I cannot say this about these few games which will be
given below. In fact, if the annotator should begin to use phrases of the type:
'in reply to... I had worked out the following variation...', the reader will
rightly say 'Grandmaster, you are showing off, since the 'oldest' of these
games is now more than 25 years old, and even the 'newest' more than 20.
Therefore, I would ask you not to regard the following 'stylised' annotations
too severely. --- The game given below was played in the Championship of the
Riga Palace of Pioneers, just at the time when the 'Golden Age' of young
Latvian chess players was beginning. If I remember correctly, A. Gipslis and Y.
Klovans, who were to become quite well known masters within a few years,
played in the Palace, while I was making my usual unsuccessful attempt to
obtain first category rating. On looking through the following game, it will
be easy to see why this attempt was unsuccessful.} 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 c5
4. exd5 {Up to this point the game has developed in similar fashion to many of
the Karpov-Korchnoi encounters in 1974. However, I don't wish to claim ...}
Qxd5 5. Ngf3 Nc6 6. Bc4 Qh5 {Modern theory takes a sceptical view of this
manoeuvre. However, in the present case I don't consider that any detailed
analysis of the opening system is necessary.} 7. dxc5 $1 {This continuation is
possibly the strongest rejoinder. If we use the 'retrospective method', it can
be supposed that the white player (who at that time already had a reputation
as a tactician) simply did not care for the prospect of the queens being
exchanged at some stage (after the capture on d4).} Bxc5 8. Ne4 Nge7 {Because
of the unpleasant threat of the knight's intrusion on d6, Black cannot keep
his bishop.} 9. Bg5 $1 {I like this move even now; it emphasises the bad
position of the black queen, while keeping the bishop under attack.} Qg4 ({
While there is no denying that this is a clever reply,} 9... b6 {was
nevertheless the lesser evil, although even in this case after} 10. Nxc5 bxc5

critical assessment is by no means a sign of the sceptical attitude of a
venerable Grandmaster to his young inexperienced namesake. If I had had to
annotate this game 25 years ago, the verdict would have been the same.} ({It
is difficult to believe that White should miss the chance to win the game
immediately using 'arithmetic':} 11. h3 Qf5 (11... Qxg2 12. Rh2) 12. g4 Qg6 13.
Nh4 Ne5 14. Bb5+ ({or} 14. Qe2 {.})) 11... O-O {The opponent is still
blissfully unaware.} ({He could have saved his queen by playing} 11... h6 {.})
12. Bf6 {Instead of capturing the queen (the variation given in the previous
note still works), White gives away a piece. No doubt the idea of placing the
bishop en prise appeared so tempting that other possibilities did not occur to
me (unfortunately, this disease from my youth sometimes recurs even now). On
the other hand, if this is the case, then the question arises as to why did
White not play Bf6 a move earlier, when at any rate it was less risky. I am
absolutely sure that my opponent's reply came as a surprise to me, and so,
much as I would like to, I cannot place this game in the category of
'intuitive' or 'Tal' sacrifices.} Qf4+ 13. Kb1 gxf6 {The situation has changed
'somewhat'. Black has an extra bishop, for which I now do not see any
compensation at all. On the other hand, it was not difficult to detect that
the black king's pawn cover had been weakened. White continues as if nothing
has happened.} 14. g3 Qh6 15. g4 Qf4 {The most logical. On this square the

{'Lucky Tal' - I have often been called this by journalists. It must be
admitted that there is a certain justification for such a nickname. After an
event, certain players like to indulge in an unusual form of statistics; they
count up the points that stand alongside their names in the tournament table,
and also those that could have been. As a rule, the number 'lost' is
significantly higher than the number 'found'. I cannot say this about myself.
Very often carelessness or indifferent technique has prevented me from
achieving victory in positions which one can confidently regard as being won,
but there have also been a number of examples of a different sort. From my
very first steps in chess I have been an 'optimist'. I think that the reader
will already have realised this, after playing through my game with Zilber.
The example given below is of the same type. On this occasion, it is true, the
ratings of the players were higher - both had first category. Moreover, if one
looks ahead, the following games come to mind: the 3rd and 4th games with
Smyslov in the 1959 Candidates Tournament, the 3rd and 17th games from the
first match with Botvinnik (incidentally, the second of these is the most
similar to the game which the reader can now see), and the game with Portisch
in the 1964 Amsterdam Interzonal. This list could easily be extended if one so
desired. --- There is no doubt that my opponents in these games had every
justification for complaining about their bad luck. I hope, however, that I in
some way 'contributed' to this bad luck.} 1. d4 f5 2. e4 fxe4 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. f3
{My opponent was very fond of accepting pawn sacrifices. Thus he regularly

pawn on c3 and be prepared to defend for a long time for the sake of it. In

{The game given below was played in the tournament which brought me my first
really important success. There was always a very tense struggle for the
Latvian Championship, and to take first place in it was a far from easy matter.
Running ahead a little, I remember how in 1958 the twice Champion of the USSR
M. Tal had to be satisfied with third place in the Championship of the
Republic. However, in the 1953 Championship I was the undisputed favourite.
This had nothing to do with chess strength - at that time I had first category
rating, while there was one master and about 10 candidate masters in the
tournament, or, to express it in the modern way, my individual rating was far
from being the highest. Simply, commencing in 1951, there was an unwritten
tradition in our Championships that the winner should be a first-year student.
In 1951 it was M. Pasman, in 1952 Y. Klyavin, and in 1953 I was the only
first-year taking part. Following the same tradition, the next year Y. Klovans
took first place, and then A. Gipslis. I succeeded in repeating my achievement
in the Championship only 12 years later, when the tradition had been forgotten,
and young players did not in general reach the final of the Championship of
the Republic. --- My opponent was one of the strongest players in Latvia, and
had already successfully competed in the USSR Championship Semi-final. M.
Pasman likes to play to a clearly defined positional plan, and so it was with
particular pleasure that I strove in this game for tactical complications,
reckoning that only in this way could I hope for success.} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6
3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {At that time the Najdorf System was only
just coming into fashion.} 6. f4 {This continuation was one of the most
popular at that time. Now, for no particular reason, it is played rather
rarely, although it brings White a high enough percentage of wins. I liked
this move for the main reason that in the 1952 USSR Championship Semi-final in
Riga (M. Pasman played in this tournament) a spectacular game was played. I am
unable to resist the temptation to give it in full. (See the following game)}

threats to his king.}) 17. Bxe7 Qxe7 18. Nd5 Qd6 19. Qg4 {White simply throws

{There are chess players whose opening tastes are noted for their exceptional
constancy. Thus, for instance, in preparing for a game with Fischer (up till
1972), one could have no doubt that, in reply to 1 e4, the Najdorf Variation
of the Sicilian Defence would definitely be played. This was confirmed by
literally all the American Grandmaster's games, beginning with childhood
competitions. Karpov, from his early years, has had a marked antipathy to
Indian set-ups, and in reply to 1 e4 normally chooses 1...e5 (more rarely 1...c5). Other players, such as Spassky, Korchnoi and Larsen, regularly vary their
openings as they think fit. The game given below is one of my first attempts
at playing a complicated opening system, with which subsequently certain
theorists even associated my name. Up till 1953 I normally adopted the Slav
Defence, the Nimzo-Indian and the King's Indian, less frequently the Dutch,
and very rarely the Grünfeld. As far as I remember, in one of the issues of
'Shakhmaty v SSSR' at that time, the game Boleslavsky-Nezhmetdinov from the
Championship of the Russian Republic appeared, in which Black treated the
system with 2...c5 in very interesting fashion. This game appealed to me, and
I began occasionally, and then fairly regularly, to adopt it in tournaments.}

have played against I. Birbrager three times, and three times this system has
appeared. Two years later, in the USSR Team Championship (this time for adults)
, the Uzbekistan player played the opening very accurately, and I think that
it was he who introduced a continuation in one of the topical variations,
which is even nowadays considered to be the strongest. A further 10 years
passed, and once again, also in the USSR Team Championship, I succeeded in
winning a game which was not without theoretical interest (though not as a
result of the opening). To return to our first encounter, it should be noted
that at that time the theory of this variation was at an embryonic stage, and
so there is nothing surprising in the numerous errors made by both players.} 6.

{'A game is not finished until the clocks are stopped'. One would expect this
chess axiom to be clear to everyone. And yet, how many times does it happen
that, in a completely won position, a blunder radically changes everything
that only a minute previously had seemed absolutely clear. Looking back on my
tournament career, I can recall a number of such extreme occurrences. The most
recent of these was in the 42nd USSR Championship, when I allowed undivided
first place to slip from my grasp. It was in my game with Vaganian. The
exchange and a pawn up, I feel puzzled: why does my opponent continue playing?
One slight mistake, a second, more serious one, yet another, and the
miraculous happens - I have to agree to a draw. By all accounts, it is a
premature weakening, a laziness which suddenly occurs at that moment when
there is only a little more to do, and is one of the innate short-comings of a
player which reveals itself fairly frequently. The following game serves (more
accurately, could have served) as evidence of this.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5

catch their opponents in prepared variations. At the time of this game I used

to evacuate his king there at the first opportunity.} d5 {Black's forces are

{Autumn 1954. Riga receives the participants in a most important event - the
Team Championship of the USSR. Petrosian, Taimanov, Averbakh, Korchnoi and
other experienced players lead their delegations. It is easy to imagine the
apprehension of a young player, finding himself for the first time in such
company. Not long before this I had succeeded in winning a classification
match for the title of master against the Byelorussian player V. Saigin by 8-6,
and although formally I took part with the 'rank' of candidate master, the
decision was expected to arrive literally at any day. It is quite natural that
the 'Daugava' team did not place great hopes on the results of its leader.
That is how it worked out in the end - a win in the first round proved to be
the only one. --- Every player has his memorable games and tournaments.
Without doubt, the first board tournament in Riga was the strongest I had
played in, and the game given below was my third encounter with a grandmaster 
(if, of course, you do not include fairly successful performances against them
in simultaneous displays). --- In the spring of the same year I had been
fortunate enough to play against the then legendary Keres in Tallinn, and even
drew one of our two encounters.} 1. e4 e5 (1... e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 {- see

theory as the Belgrade Gambit.} Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. Nd5 (5. Nd5 Nxe4 6. Qe2 f5 7.

that on his 'home ground' (the Championship was held in Leningrad) it was
Boris who had the support of the spectators; I did not like this, and I played
somewhat strangely: first limply (in the opening), then over-sharply (in the

tournament, the reviewers considered that a share of 5th place was not bad for
a first appearance, but I myself was dissatisfied. Since the Championship, as
has already been said, was weakened, and since the competitors were, in the
main, winners of the Semi-finals like myself, I had hoped to do better. In the
first instance, in the creative sense. Thus, for instance, in my game against
Taimanov, an extra piece proved insufficient to win: I was deceived by the
'shuffling' of the pieces. Although similar 'presents' were also made to me,
one forgets about them, whereas one remembers one's own mistakes for a long
time... --- Soon after the Championship I had my first trip abroad. With the
USSR Student Team I set off for the World Championship in Sweden. There were a
great number of new, colourful impressions, plus the special character of the
'Little Olympiad' - everyone was young and good-humoured, and got on well
together, while the language barrier was overcome 'from the first move' - all
this sticks in my mind for ever. --- From the point of view of the result, our
team, which consisted entirely of future Grandmasters, won easily. I was
awarded the prize for the best result on board 3. Of interest was my game with
Ivkov, which is given here. --- The year 1956 ended somewhat dramatically.
Despite a poor result in the match between Latvia and Estonia, I was
considered favourite for the USSR Championship Semi-final in Tbilisi. I will
not now undertake to explain what was at the bottom of it, but the tournament
turned out to be extremely difficult for me. --- After 12 rounds my column of
the tournament table showed one win (and goodness knows, the victory was not
exactly convincing in an ending with four queens against Kasparian), two zeros
and nine (!!) draws. In addition, the defeats were extremely vexing, being the
result of bad blunders. --- The one thing that cheered me up was a stubborn
and successful defence as Black against Korchnoi in our game from the 12th
round. Once again around the hundred-move mark (!), the game ended in a draw,
and even now I do not know whether it was to this that lowed my spurt at the
finish: 6 out of 7. As a result I succeeded in 'catching hold' of the last
step on the finalists' train departing for Moscow. --- However, it is not
impossible that a part was played by a conversation with my trainer Koblents,
who was appearing in the same Semi-final. He had played well in these 12
rounds to be amongst the leaders, and I jokingly said to him: 'Don't be upset
Maestro! We will still be going to the Final together, only this time I will
be your second'. --- Towards the end Koblents faded, and in the Final
'tradition was maintained'.} *

{On to January 1957. The Championship of the Soviet Union was a strong
tournament and very interesting indeed from the creative point of view. I do
not say this because I succeeded in winning, but because that is how it really
was. Tolush, for instance, gave several brilliant examples of attack; the
experienced Bronstein and Keres played with enthusiasm; and it was here that
the normally reserved Petrosian demonstrated that he was able - and how! - to
play 'open' chess. He lost several (for him) games, but was able to win even
more. I also succeeded in winning several interesting encounters. --- Contrary
to normal practice, the start of the tournament went well for me: the game
with Aronson is given here. Then I won three further games in a row, including
one against the previous year's Champion Taimanov, and my first ever game
against my idol Bronstein, whose play has always been for me an example, and
if you like - a yardstick. The fourth victory, against Bannik, continued the
gallery of my games, already quite long, where my opponent set a trap and I
fell into it, but in doing so I continued the variation for a further few
moves, which allowed me to find a 'hole' in the trap. --- I dropped my first
half point in the fifth round, and, of course, it was in my game with Korchnoi,
while in the sixth round I was drastically punished by Nezhmetdinov for
incorrectly assessing the position. --- The following could have been my best
game in the Championship. After interesting complications this was the
position reached:} 25. Rxb2 {I sacrificed the exchange!} Nxb2 26. Qd5+ Kh8 27.
Qd4 Rxd7 28. Qxd7 Rg8 29. Ng5 h6 30. Nf7+ Kh7 {, and here I thought that in
the variation} 31. Qf5+ g6 32. Qd7 gxh5 33. Ng5+ Kg6 34. Qe6+ Kxg5 35. g3 h4
36. f4+ Kh5 {, I could not play 37 g2(!!!)-g4, because Black would take en
passant. About the fact that the pawn was already on g3, and that the mate by
37 g3-g4 is quite legal, I somehow forgot. --- After the game (not having
found a mate, I quickly won back the exchange and agreed a draw) this was
naturally pointed out to me by Geller, Bronstein, and someone else, and then I
really went to pieces. There followed four draws in a row, which is nothing to
boast about, and then a game against Boleslavsky adjourned in a poor position,
which in the end I lost. --- By the adjournment day my mood improved
significantly, for I succeeded in winning an interesting game against
Petrosian. Then things got better. I managed to defeat Keres (the game is
given in the book), who was leading at the time, in positional style, which
was a surprise even to me, and went ahead together with Bronstein. In the
following round, the 17th, I played a game which brought me half a point,
enormous satisfaction, and a special prize (see the following game).} *

I sacrificed a piece against Gurgenidze and won in 27 moves, then there
followed two draws, so that before the last round three of us were sharing
first place: Bronstein, Tolush and myself. My last round opponent was Tolush,
while Bronstein had to play Kholmov, against whom 'by order' no one won at
that time, so that a draw would assure me of a share of first place. --- I'll
go back just a little. In the penultimate round I had drawn with Kholmov as
Black, while my opponent needed to win in order to reach the Grandmaster norm
for the second and last time. He tried very hard, but around move 30 the
position had become so simplified that I allowed myself to begin peace
negotiations. --- Kholmov very sharply rejected the offer and sank into
thought for an hour, during which time I began imagining all sorts of terrible
things. Then he raised his eyes from the board, said 'Draw!', and we began
analysing. To the question, what had he been thinking about for so long,
Kholmov replied: 'About how I will win tomorrow as Black against Bronstein ...'
} (36... -- {JOURNALIST. It is perhaps not convenient to interrupt you at such
a crowning moment, but I would, nevertheless, like to know whether extraneous
thoughts ever enter your head during a game? --- CHESS PLAYER. Oh yes! For
instance, I will never forget my game with Grandmaster Vasiukov in one of the
USSR Championships. We reached a very complicated position where I was
intending to sacrifice a knight. The sacrifice was not altogether obvious, and
there were a large number of possible variations, but when I conscientiously
began to work through them, I found, to my horror, that nothing would come of
it. Ideas piled up one after another. I would transport a subtle reply by my
opponent, which worked in one case, to another situation where it would
naturally prove to be quite useless. As a result my head became filled with a
completely chaotic pile of all sorts of moves, and the famous 'tree of
variations', from which the trainers recommend that you cut off the small
branches, in this case spread with unbelievable rapidity. --- Then suddenly,
for some reason, I remembered the classic couplet by Korney Ivanovich
Chukovsky: Oh, what a difficult job it was. --- To drag out of the marsh the
hippopotamus. --- I don't know from what associations this hippopotamus got
onto the chessboard, but although the spectators were convinced that I was
continuing to study the position, I, despite my humanitarian education, was
trying at this time to work out: just how would you drag a hippopotamus out of
a marsh? I remember how jacks figured in my thoughts, as well as levers,
helicopters, and even a rope ladder. --- After lengthy consideration I
admitted defeat as an engineer, and thought spitefully: 'Well, let it drown!'
Suddenly the hippopotamus disappeared, went from the chessboard just as he had
come on - of his own accord! Straight away the position did not appear to be
so complicated. I somehow realised that it was not possible to calculate all
the variations, and that the knight sacrifice was, by its very nature, purely
intuitive. Since it promised an interesting game, I could not refrain from
making it. --- The following day, it was with pleasure that I read in the
paper how Mikhail Tal, after carefully thinking over the position for 40
minutes, made an accurately calculated piece sacrifice. --- To return to the
Championship; the last round game, taking into account the fact that I was
White and that my opponent was the uncompromising Tolush, was bound to be a
fighting game, and that is how it turned out (see the following game).})

begun so well soon brought me grief. My father died, and for several months I
was out of sorts. Even my final state exams were put off until the following
spring. I returned to chess only in the summer, when I played in the World
Students' Championship in Reykjavik. The USSR had a formidable team: two
Grandmasters plus several strong masters, so that there was essentially no
battle for the cup. I played well, and one of my games, that with Kolarov, is
given here. --- Two further team events followed: the Championship of Europe,
and a semi-tourist, semi-serious trip to Italy, which was absolutely
unforgettable. At the 12th Olympiad in Moscow the previous year, the Italian
team had invited us to playa series of friendly matches. I hope that they will
not be offended if I admit that, even at the board (we were, after all, barely
adults), we were thinking of how we would wander around Venice, touch the
stone of the ancient Coliseum, and visit La Scala and St. Peter's Cathedral.
--- Nevertheless, we played assiduously, winning all five matches. One of the
games was rather unusual. Before the start of play my opponent, the master
Sabadosh, a charming, kind man already advanced in years, came up to me and
said that he had to his credit draws with Alekhine, Lasker and Euwe. In my
youthful ignorance, I did not realise that this was a veiled offer of a draw,
and since I had a cold, in reply I asked him to excuse me for the fact that I
would spend as little time as possible at the board, so as to avoid infecting
him. Indeed, I used only 7 minutes on my clock, but this was enough to win the
game. To the credit of Signor Sabadosh he was not offended, and when, being
unable to attend the banquet, I was lying in my hotel room, he sent me wine,
fruit, and, as a souvenir, a fashionable tie of unbelievable colouring. When I
returned home, the doctors established post factum that I had been suffering
from pneumonia.} (42. -- {JOURNALIST. And didn't your new title protect you?
--- CHESS PLAYER. The title was indeed new. During the Championship of Europe
a FIDE Congress was held, and our Federation proposed me for the title of
International Grandmaster. The formal grounds for this were clearly inadequate.
--- In the first place I was not an International Master, and secondly I had
not reached the Grandmaster norm in an international tournament. Against this,
the argument was put forward that I was the USSR Champion, and had won the
title in a very strong tournament. The decision taken by the Congress was
truly Solomon-like: I was 'exchanged' for L. Evans and A. Bisguier, who had
failed to make the norm by something like half a point, and we all three were
raised to the rank of Grandmaster. --- The following year, 1958, found me both
at home, and away: the Championship of the Soviet Union was held in Riga.}) (
42. -- {JOURNALIST. Is it better to play on your home ground or not? --- CHESS
PLAYER. For footballers it is without doubt an advantage. Everything is
familiar, and they have the support of the fans, but in chess it is by no
means certain. --- On the strength of my experience, I can say: it is good to
be 'at home' when one is playing well. If things are not working out so well,
playing at home is more difficult. In addition, the Championship was a Zonal
Tournament, so that I was therefore making my debut in the battle for the
World Title.}) (42. -- {JOURNALIST. Were you planning to repeat your success,
or...? --- CHESS PLAYER. That's it - 'or'. I didn't think especially about
first place, but with the tournament being the Zonal, Koblents and I made
plans for me to finish in the first four so as to go forward to the Interzonal.
}) (42. -- {JOURNALIST. Do you still set yourself targets, and plan your
results? --- CHESS PLAYER. Only very relatively. Usually I leave this to my
second, or my wife. They suggest to me a schedule, or, more accurately, three:
a maximum programme, a minimum, and a so-called realistic programme. The
maximum is nothing but wins, the minimum is a little over 50% (where defeats
are not intended!), while the realistic programme is somewhere in between. ---
So, it was festival time in Riga. Apart from the usual spectators, my pupils
were also watching the play. I was in my probationary period at school, and
the class to which I taught literature consisted almost entirely of fanatical
chess players.}) (42. -- {JOURNALIST. Is it true that they once played chess
during one o/your lessons? --- CHESS PLAYER. On this occasion you are right.
When I first went into this class, there was a board with the pieces set out
on the window-sill. I decided that this must be a new form of 'boot-licking'
before the teacher, and, casting a professional glance over the board, I saw
that White could give mate in four moves. --- Then I committed a pedagogical
mistake, turning my back on the class for two or three minutes while following
a pupil who I had called up to the blackboard. --- When I turned round again
to face the rest of the class, I saw that the position on the board had
changed, and that White no longer had even an attack, never mind a mate in
four. It was clear that the combatants preferred play to study. Having
established who the players were, I severely demanded that the lads give me
their mark books, which, as it happened, were simply lying on the teacher's
desk. At the end of the lesson I returned them, and said: 'Let's come to and
understanding: chess and studying don't go together!' --- 'Black' silently
took back his mark book, but 'White' asked for my autograph. --- And in his
mark book I had to write: 'Failed to find a mate in four during a literature
lesson'. After this we became friends. --- In the Championship I began with a
game against Tolush. A hum of expectation greeted our appearance on the stage:
our game from the last round of the previous year's Championship was still in
people's minds. On this occasion Tolush was in poor form, and played badly.
But I found, as early as the third round, that the battle promised to be very
difficult for me also. --- Against Boleslavsky in the King's Indian Defence I
employed one of my rare opening innovations, quickly won a pawn, and obtained
good winning chances. --- All I had to do was to make one prophylactic move,
but this seemed fainthearted to me. I immediately occupied an open file with
my rook, and Black's pieces came to life. At some point I considered that it
was too early to offer a draw, but when I actually decided to speak, I saw
that it was already too late.}) (42. -- {JOURNALIST. Your second successive
defeat against Boleslavsky... if someone defeats you. Does this tend to
repeat itself in subsequent games? --- CHESS PLAYER. It is more accurate to
say that this happens after a defeat in the first game. In such cases there is
indeed an unpleasant tradition of things being repeated.}) (42. -- {JOURNALIST.
What in general do you think about the problem of revenge? --- CHESS PLAYER.
There is an old Russian proverb: 'The father hit his son, not because he
gambled, but because he tried to win back his losses.' In principle, striving
for revenge - chess revenge! - is a good intention, but when it becomes an end
in itself, and this has often happened to me, then you lose your sense of
reality and of objectivity in assessing a position, and instead of revenge you
have quite the opposite. I have no doubt that this is what explains, for
instance, my catastrophic score against Korchnoi.}) (42. -- {JOURNALIST. But
in that case, wouldn't it be more sensible to forget the past, and begin each
game with the score at nil-nil? --- CHESS PLAYER. Of course it would, but
emotions arise of their own accord. --- Let us return to the Championship.
Next I won a game against Averbakh, which is given here, and which provoked
great arguments until the theorists showed that my piece sacrifice was
inadequate, and that by an intermediate move White could have kept his
material advantage.}) (42. -- {JOURNALIST. Just a minute! How was it that you
sacrificed a piece, without special justification, against a Grandmaster? What
were you counting on? --- CHESS PLAYER. The point is that all leading
Grandmasters have a chess 'character', which is well known. Averbakh likes,
and always heads for, positions where the situation is absolutely clear.
Indeed, in our game this psychological trait manifested itself completely. On
the very next move, in an attempt to clarify the situation, Averbakh simply
returned the sacrificed piece. I do not know whether he did this deliberately,
or whether he overlooked something and the game immediately transposed into a
position of a clearly defined type, with Black having an extra pawn.
Objectively speaking, the position could still have perhaps been held, but by
now Averbakh was already in time-trouble, and he overlooked a little tactical
stroke which led to great material losses. The sacrifice would have had no
chance at all against players such as Korchnoi or Kholmov, who readily go in
for sharp complications with the aim of keeping material which has been
sacrificed against them.}) (42. -- {JOURNALIST. So you wouldn't have taken
such a step against them? --- CHESS PLAYER. At any rate I would have thought
about it longer, since at the board I could not see a direct refutation of the
sacrifice. --- Of the other encounters, I recall very well the one with
Petrosian. I obtained the better position, but it was here that I realised
that I still had much to learn in the way of strategy. The exchange sacrifice
offered by Petrosian was at the same time both the strongest and the only move.
Today, I would have declined it without hesitation, thus keeping the
initiative, but on that occasion I won the exchange, and... adjourned the
game in a critical position. On resumption I slipped out, not without the
assistance of my opponent.}) (42. -- {JOURNALIST. This was an example of
Petrosian's famous sense of danger. How well is it developed in your case? ---
CHESS PLAYER. Not at all, I'm afraid. I still don't understand how I have been
able to go through certain tournaments without defeat. --- The middle of the
tournament turned out very badly for me. After refusing a draw, I blundered in
the game with that same Korchnoi (there you are, trying for revenge!), and
then this was repeated in my game with Bannik, against whom I had a clean
score up till then. True, in this case there were 'collaborators' in my defeat.
I caught a cold, had a slight temperature, and was given an injection of
antibiotics. --- However, the nurse made a mistake, and gave me a sedative. My
friends noticed that during the game (it took place on the day for
adjournments) I was not my usual self. I didn't walk about at all, but all the
time sat at my table, looking at the board with a melancholy gaze. I also
played very limply. I got into a bad position, then Bannik made a hash of
things. The game became level and I began to wonder whether I shouldn't try to
win. I forgot about everything else, including my clock. It was only the
demonstrator's stare that warned me that I had only a few seconds remaining
and I seized the nearest pawn and pushed it forward, thus compromising my
whole kingside. I lasted as far as the time control, but no further. --- After
this I found that my score was down to 50%, with almost half the tournament
over, and with very little to hope for. --- Perhaps it was this that allowed
me to begin playing easily and calmly. I won several games in a row, and then
Polugaevsky and I played a semi-dramatic, semi-comic game. In the
time-scramble I lost part of my advantage, and in the adjourned position was a
pawn up, but whether this was sufficient to win was not clear. In addition, we
did not consider Polugaevsky's sealed move at all, which was to move his king
towards mine. --- The game continued, and then the moment arrived when I had
to either exchange rooks and straight away agree to a draw, or else for no
reason at all give up two pawns. I was very angry, partly because the previous
day my opponent had offered me a draw in an inferior position, and partly
because I had failed to guess his sealed move; without really thinking, I
chose the second path, whereupon it took desperate efforts on my part to gain
the draw. --- Even so, my fight to reach the top four and the Interzonal was
going well. Towards the finish the pace of the leaders had slowed considerably,
and after a win in the penultimate round, I went ahead together with Petrosian,
with Bronstein half a point, and Averbakh and Spassky a point behind. One of
us had to go! The piquancy of the situation was increased by the fact the last
round pairings were Petrosian-Averbakh, myself against Spassky, and
Bronstein-Korchnoi, so that no-one ventured to predict the results. --- It
turned out that, of the three games, only one was to be decisive. My rivals
quickly agreed draws, whereas Spassky and I were engaged in a battle not for
life, but to the death. Strictly speaking, a draw would have suited me:
firstly, this would have enabled me to share first place, and secondly, I was
playing Black. --- But Spassky had no desire at all for a play-off match with
Averbakh for fourth place. The result was a sharp variation of the
Nimzo-Indian, then at some point Spassky did not play as energetically as was
possible and an equal position was reached. When I offered a draw, he refused.
This was possibly because he had a score of two wins and two draws against me,
but it seemed to me that Boris knew about my carefully-guarded secret - I was
still unwell. --- Be that as it may, but I immediately made a bad move, and
got into difficulties which grew and grew. Somewhere before the time control I
could have gained a draw by going into a rook ending a pawn down, but instead
I chose a heavy-piece ending where my king was in danger. --- We analysed
until five o'clock in the morning. There appeared to be no direct win for
White, but my position was highly unpleasant. Then my second sent me off to
sleep for about three hours: the resumption was in the morning, at nine. ---
My difficulties began while still on the approach to the tournament hall.
Despite the fact that it was a weekday, there was a mass of fans around the
entrance, and it was practically impossible to flight one's way through. My
pupils, who had simply skipped their lessons, were also gathered there. ---
The game was resumed. Out of the corner of my eye I could see Petrosian in a
new suit, white shirt and tie, apparently all ready for his interview as
Champion. --- In the small buffet behind the stage Spassky was feverishly
drinking kefir (Translator's note: A sour milk product, similar to yoghurt.) -
it seemed that he too had only slept a little. --- For the first six moves or
so a forced variation was followed, and then up to a certain point Spassky
played very well; only six months later was it found how he could have won. In
over-the-board play, after a sleepless night, he was unable to solve this
difficult problem. In addition, he was not in the best of moods - in the
penultimate round he had suffered a defeat. --- After we had played about
another fifteen moves there were still only two possible results: either
Spassky would at any moment force a draw, or else he would convert his
advantage into a win. Even so, my position was improving 'inch by inch', and
finally White was faced with a choice: he had to force a draw, or else the
position would become more complicated, and the number of possible results
would be increased to three. --- Spassky did not force a draw, but after a
couple more moves, with both kings now under fire, he offered one in a
somewhat changed voice. To be honest, I was embarrassed. In the first place, I
had always held a certain sympathy for Boris. --- Secondly, I very much wanted
to play in the lightning tournament which was just about to begin. However,
everyone, myself included, had been greatly carried away by the game, and
besides, to agree a draw would have been unethical from the chess point of
view: for the first time in the game I had the chance to play for a win, and
it was just now, and not a minute earlier, that the game would have been
concluded. --- All this flashed through my mind for 30-40 seconds, and then I
declined the offer. --- Immediately I saw how Spassky, who always plays, I
would say, with theatrical calmness, began to get nervous. It became clear
that it was now difficult for him to decide on the correct continuation, and
indeed it was all over within five moves, with my king, which had broken out
of captivity, taking part in the execution of his white colleague.}) (42. -- {
JOURNALIST. I realise that an enemy in life, and an 'enemy' at the board are
different notions, but do any human feelings towards the opponent - respect,
enmity, liking - have an influence on the course of a game? --- CHESS PLAYER.
Naturally! Although sometimes in a strange way. For instance, neither Spassky
nor I have the slightest willingness to play against opponents for whom we
have a feeling of enmity, whereas Botvinnik and Korchnoi try to rouse this
feeling in themselves before a game. --- Strange though it may seem, it was
after our tragic encounter in the Championship that Boris and I became friends.
He put himself in my place, and realised that it was not personal enmity
towards him that caused me to reject his offer of a draw. I think that he
would have done the same, if he had been in my place. --- The result of this
game proved to be a surprise to everyone: to Averbakh, who had been hoping
against hope for a play-off match with Spassky, to Petrosian, to Spassky, and,
for all my optimism, to myself.}) (42. -- {JOURNALIST. And how did the fans
react? --- CHESS PLAYER. They went wild! --- Even so, it is always more
difficult for me to play in Riga than anywhere else. --- What I have in mind
is the Championship of the Republic. If, to the rest of the world, I was
already twice USSR Champion, International Grandmaster and so on, to my
colleagues at home I was still the same Misha. Therefore I could not expect
any special deference at the board, and in the Latvian Championship two months
later I only took third place. In fact, I obtained the highest percentage of
points in all my appearances in the Championship, 16 out of 19, but two others
scored 17! --- The fate of the tournament was decided by an incident which can
only be called an anecdote. Before my game with Gipslis I was preparing for my
University State Exam in Russian. This included Old Church Slavonic, Old
Russian, Dialectology, and God knows what else, and so I was surrounded by
some ten kilos of specialist literature. But suddenly the door bell rang, and
the postman arrived with, besides the rest of the mail, the latest issue of
Shakhmatny Bulletin. I decided that fate itself was calling on me to relax, so
I lay down in a hot bath and began reading the magazine. Straight away I came
across an article by N. Krogius on a topical variation of the Sicilian Defence.
At that time I readily played this line both as White and Black, and here I
suddenly read: 'Recently Black has frequently adopted the new continuation ...e5'. There followed two games, one of which Black won, while the second was
drawn. --- That's excellent, I thought, I'll have a quick draw in this
variation with Gipslis, and then return to Philology. --- As if it had been
pre-arranged, inside 5 minutes we had played the moves of the variation given
in the article, but when I made the 'recommended' move ...e5, a thought
suddenly struck me: but what if White plays simply Bc4? Gipslis, however, did
not give me time to torture myself mentally, but straight away made this move.
--- The game continued for the full five hours, after which I had a hopeless
position, and all that I achieved was an adjournment. --- The following
morning I passed my exam, but resigned the game, whereupon we began analysing
it. The first question that Gipslis asked was: 'Didn't you get the bulletin
then?' --- 'Yes, why shouldn't I have?' --- Here he took the bulletin out of
his briefcase, showed me the move ...e5, then turned over a page (!),
whereupon I read the very first line: 'However, by answering ...e5 with Bc4,
White sets his opponent difficult problems.' --- Since then I have never
prepared for a game while lying in a hot bath. --- However, there was no real
need to feel distressed. Shortly after this I went away to the south on the
insistence of my doctors, who had detected some mystical (as it turned out)
spots in my lungs, and after I had been detained for a couple of weeks in a
sanatorium, Koblents arrived, and we began making unhurried preparations for
the Interzonal Tournament. Then a telegram from our Chess Federation arrived:
'We would very much like you to play in the World Students' Team Championship,
only in the most important matches'. I was really pleased. I was bored with
the resort, and I felt fine, so I flew straight away to Moscow. True, the most
important matches proved to be all ten, and I enjoyed playing them, while for
the right to play the tenth game, Spassky and I drew lots. --- Incidentally,
on this occasion the main burden was borne by the top two boards, and when the
following year Boris and I did not take part, our team dropped back, thus
suggesting that the problem of preparing our young players was problem number
one. A successful solution was found two years later.}) 1-0

{The Three Rooks' Sacrifice: Very often, while delivering lectures, I have to
answer certain questions: 'Could you explain how you prepare yourself for
tournaments?' or similarly 'What is the best way to prepare for important
competitions?' --- I have to say at once that readymade formulae do not exist.
The only possible solution, which must be strictly kept in mind, is that one
should always be conscious of one's individual style and consider future plans
to develop it. --- Twenty years ago Botvinnik proposed his own system to help
developing chess players in their preparation. In his system, great attention
was drawn to two points. Firstly, theoretical preparation: mainly analysis of
specific variations, and secondly, psychological preparation. It is
interesting to note that Botvinnik owned files containing the games of all
possible future opponents. Botvinnik would also give great importance to his
physical preparation for important tournaments. --- Nowadays, with the
considerable improvement in chess standards, this system is somewhat out of
date. For example, it is not quite clear whether it is correct to play
intensively in tournament after tournament. Botvinnik's answer is 'no' and he
also confirms this by not playing too often. On the other hand Grandmaster
Gligoric plays very often and I have to add that, even by doing so, he never
loses his good form. --- One other question: 'When ought one experiment?' It
is no secret that most competitions are aimed at qualification or are held for
some other important competitive reason, and a tournament's narrow frame of
calculation does not allow the chess player to use his full imagination - it
is not easy to play in a style which one would use in a practice game. In this
last sentence we perhaps discover the answer to all our previous questions!?
--- Indeed, when chess players meet in training games, which do not decide
qualification or other achievements, they can try out some of the most
interesting or dangerous variations, and it is up to the opponents to decide
either to disclose the results or to keep them to themselves for a 'fight
night' surprise. --- I would like to draw readers' attention to the following
practice game, which I played with my trainer Koblents.} 1. d4 e6 2. c4 f5 3.

{The reader is no doubt well aware of the significance of this encounter,
which took place in the last round. (Translator's note: Victory would give Tal
clear first place; Spassky needed to win in order to make certain of
qualifying for the Portoroz Interzonal.) In order to reach his respective goal,
each player needed to win; this left its on the course of the game. The
opening was played rather unusually by both sides. --- Spassky and I in turn
offered pawn sacrifices, and then Black offered the exchange, although this
sacrifice also remained 'behind the scenes'. On the 23rd move I considered the
position to be sufficiently simple and level, and I offered a draw. White
decided that he could, without risk, continue the struggle, and perhaps he was
right. In any case, it was I who committed the first mistake, after which
Spassky seized the initiative. He conducted the middle section of the game
superbly and at the adjournment Black's position gave serious call for alarm.
Play was to resume in twelve hours' time. --- One can easily imagine how I
analysed the adjourned position, together with my trainer A. Koblents. At
about five o'clock in the morning the analysis was terminated for 'technical
reasons' (one of the analysts fell asleep). Nevertheless, when I went along to
the resumption, I considered that the game should finish as a draw. That is
how it should have been. For a long time Black maintained the equilibrium,
though it is true that, in order to do this, he had to find a number of
difficult moves. The strength of one of these was evidently underestimated by
Spassky, who, by inertia continued playing for a win in a now level position.
Now the advantage was on Black's side, and his counter-attack became
irresistible.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. a3 ({In preparing for this

attack on the kingside. One only has to recall the wonderful game
Botvinnik-Capablanca (AVRO 1938), where White sacrificed his knight on h5, or

at g7 concluded the struggle.} 11. f3 ({Keres points out that White could have

{The Interzonal Tournament was now approaching; incidentally, this was the
first individual international event in my career. --- The conditions in the
tournament were rather severe. For the first time, the rule came into force
that, from anyone country (read - USSR!) no more than two (at first), and then
no more than three (as was decided after 12 rounds) players could go forward
from the Interzonal to the Candidates Tournament. Therefore, each of the
Soviet quartet was required not only to win, but to come ahead of at least one
of his compatriots. In short, only 1st-3rd places guaranteed success, compared
with 1st-6th places for the remaining contestants. Jumping ahead a little, I
would like to say that on this, my first visit to Yugoslavia, I played well,
and this happy tradition has continued ever since: I frequently visit this
country, which is so hospitable to chess players, and regarding my results in
tournaments and matches (touch wood!) as yet I have no cause for complaint.
Great interest was also roused by the debut in the international arena (as far
as the World Championship is concerned) of the youthful (if one can consider a
mere 15 year-old to be a youth) Robert Fischer. Shortly before the Interzonal
he stopped off in Moscow for the first, and unfortunately as yet the last time,
but there he only played a few lightning games. He was often asked to give
interviews (at that time Robert would still agree to this), and everyone was
startled by the fact that Fischer, answering questions quite freely, said that
on the whole he would have expected to take first place, but that this would
be difficult, since first place could be taken by Bronstein. --- As far as I
am aware, this is the first and last time that Fischer voluntarily put someone
else ahead of himself. However, Fischer had no doubt at all that he would
finish in the first six. --- 'But how will you do this', correspondents asked
him. --- 'Very simply. I reckon that I have to find five opponents against
whom I can win. This means that I will win five games, and draw the rest',
Fischer replied. --- 'And suppose you lose to someone?' --- 'That's nothing to
worry about; then I will have to win six games.'} 1. -- {At first it seemed
that this was nothing more than youthful bravado, since in the early rounds
Fischer played badly. At the start he drew with Neikirch, having had the
inferior position as White as early as the 14th move. Two moves later the
Bulgarian Champion unexpectedly offered a draw. When the journalists asked him
why he had done this, Neikirch replied: 'It was somehow embarrassing to win
against the lad, on my return home to Bulgaria they would laugh at me.' ---
Following this, Fischer won a lost game against the little-known master Fuster
and, within a day or two, in crushing style... lost to Benko. From then on,
amazingly, the young player improved literally with every round. The draw
brought him up against all our players somewhere in the middle of the
tournament. His first opponent was Bronstein, then Averbakh, myself and
Petrosian. All four games were very tense, and our players were by no means
peaceably inclined, but nevertheless all the games were drawn. My encounter
with the American Champion was fairly sharp. A roughly equal position was
reached, but I very much wanted to avoid drawing with this boy, so I played
riskily, after which Fischer gained a dangerous attack. Then he made a mistake,
and with an unexpected move I seized the initiative. At this point Fischer
offered me a draw, but I declined. --- He was in time-trouble, and, with
literally only seconds remaining on his clock, on the 39th move found the only
reply, a very strong one, which enabled him to maintain the equilibrium. The
game was adjourned, but the following day I myself offered a draw, since it
was clear that neither Black nor White could win. --- Before this I had
managed to start the tournament fairly well, but then there followed a highly
annoying defeat at the hands of Hatanovic. In a fashionable variation of the
Sicilian Defence I played very carelessly in the opening, and went to win a
piece, but this turned out to be a variation prepared by my opponent. I am not
especially accustomed to defending, and although I obtained excellent drawing
chances thanks to my opponent's mistakes, I nevertheless lost. Therefore on
the following day I went along to play Filip in the mood 'win or bust'. In a
sharp position I decided on a piece sacrifice, which, if declined, would lead
to a slightly inferior position for Filip, while its acceptance would have
unpredictable consequences. --- It would appear that the sacrifice was not
100% correct, but before making his move and capturing the piece, Filip
offered me a draw. I realised that there was something in the character of the
position that my opponent did not like, so I declined the offer, and in the
subsequent confusion somehow outwitted him. It was at that time that the
following phrase originated, addressed by one of the spectators to my second:
'If Tal has an open file, then there will be a mate!'. Although to be honest,
it should be said that in this particular game there was no great likelihood
of a mate. In the middle of the tournament there came a sort of pause of three
successive draws, and, reckoning that I had no right to such 'peacefulness' 
(although all three games were quite hard fought), in my game with Rossetto I
declined a draw in a position which was perhaps even rather dubious. --- This
affected my opponent, who proceeded to lose in the concluding stage for no
particular reason. Then came a win over Benko, and I established myself in the
leading group. I could be fairly sure of my entry into the Candidates
Tournament.} (1. -- {It was the two final rounds, in which I met in turn the
young Western players Panno and Olafsson, which proved to be decisive as
regards the winner of the tournament. I was leading, since Larsen, angered by
the loss he had suffered at my hands the previous day, had played with great
enthusiasm against my nearest rival Petrosian, and had defeated him. Then came
the ordeal of the last two rounds. The game with Panno gave me enormous
satisfaction, and it was later awarded the prize for the most interesting game
of the tournament (it is given here with notes). However, it was adjourned in
a highly complicated position, and we racked our brains for a long time,
trying to find a way to win. Tired, I decided to have a quick draw with
Olafsson. In my youthful ignorance, I never considered that my opponent might
play for a win. --- Once again I played the opening very light-heartedly,
quickly exchanged several pieces, but failed to make an accurate, very
essential move. I offered a draw immediately after this. Olafsson declined.
Only then did I look more deeply into the position, and realised that my offer
of a draw had been somewhat tactless. In short, my opponent adjourned the game
in a completely won position. The games were to be resumed the following day.
A win against Panno was considerably more doubtful than a defeat against
Olafsson. We put the game against the Argentinean Grandmaster to one side, and
began looking through the possibilities in the quiet, dull rook ending against
the Icelander, every minute becoming more and more convinced that things were
very, very bad. --- In the end we hit upon an idea which at first sight seemed
completely absurd, whereby I simply moved my king away from the enemy passed
pawn, but where we found some ways for my opponent to go wrong. In the
alternative case my opponent would have to demonstrate some elementary
technical knowledge, whereas here I could lose much more quickly, but Olafsson
would also have the chance to make a mistake. --- Koblents and I showed our
analysis to Lev Abramov, the leader of our delegation, and asked him what he,
a chess master, would do in such a case. He unhesitatingly opted for the
second possibility. The game with Panno was the first to be resumed, and it
ended surprisingly easily, since Panno had considered his position to be lost,
and had not analysed it very carefully. After this, employing my not very
great acting talent, I resumed my game against Olafsson, and tried to play as
confidently as possible, especially since Olafsson, as was his habit, had
thought for a long time over his sealed move - 45 minutes - and had relatively
little time left. Of course, in normal circumstances this would have been
sufficient to win, but Olafsson also became nervous. When I led my king away
from his pawn, he sank into thought, and used up a further six minutes. His
first move was correct, his second also, but on the third move he went wrong,
and a drawn position was reached by force. After this the question of first
place was essentially decided.}) (1. -- {JOURNALIST. Didn't such a meteoric
rise frighten you to some extent? --- CHESS PLAYER. To be honest, I thought
that everything was going quite normally, and besides, I have always been of
the opinion that, of the two evils-under-estimation and over-estimation of
one's own strength - the former is much the more harmful. Almost directly from
Portoroz, we set off to the Olympiad in Munich. Petrosian and I were making
our debuts in the role of reserves, although certain of my friends said that
to some extent this belittled the achievement of twice winning the
Championship of the Soviet Union. However, I was very well aware that
Botvinnik, playing on board one, and Smyslov on board two, and Keres and
Bronstein had given a great deal more to chess than had Tal or Petrosian, and
so, as far as I was concerned, this team order was the only one possible. ---
Besides, I had never played against Botvinnik or Smyslov, I had once come
ahead of Keres by half a point, which does not mean a great deal, while
Bronstein had always been my idol. --- At the Olympiad, Petrosian and I had a
comparatively easy task, since at that time the class of play of our opponents
on the bottom boards was not especially high. We both made a pretty good score.
A couple of games stick in my mind, and especially the one with Trifunovic,
which was very interesting. When, prior to the match, the Yugoslavs were
deciding who to put up against Tal, they chose the 'old fox', as Trifunovic
was called by the Yugoslavs themselves, a highly tenacious player, stubborn in
defence although insufficiently aggressive. --- I played this game with great
enthusiasm, for I realised that to win against Trifunovic was a problem of, so
to speak, increased complexity. In addition, he very much wanted not to lose.
After the game, Trifunovic's colleagues came up and congratulated him on the
draw, since at one time his position had appeared somewhat dubious. He replied:
'Yes, I got a draw, but it wasn't at all easy'. --- Seventeen years later, in
the International Tournament at Las Palmas, I was playing against the Yugoslav
Grandmaster Ljubojevi6, who in 1975 was of roughly the same age as I had been
in 1958! In this game I got into a difficult position, but then after highly
interesting complications it ended in a draw. This time the other players came
up and congratulated me on my good defence, and I quite involuntarily repeated
Trifunovic's phrase: 'Yes, but it wasn't at all easy'.}) (1. -- {JOURNALIST.
Did you think in Munich that you might possibly have to play a match against
Botvinnik? --- CHESS PLAYER. Not really. The Candidates Tournament was due to
take place a year later, and it seemed a long way off, but I gained great
pleasure from watching the play of the World Champion.}) (1. -- {JOURNALIST.
Did you examine it closely? --- CHESS PLAYER. No, no, not specially. Simply
for the first time I was on the same stage where the Champion was playing, and
was present when he was analysing. --- This made a great impression on me,
almost as if I were an amateur. --- 1959 began, as was the tradition at that
time, with the Championship of the Soviet Union. I set off for Tbilisi
'burdened' by having been twice USSR Champion. --- I realised perfectly well
that it was somewhat unusual and 'improper' for one player to win the
Championship twice in a row. I further realised that, on this occasion, the
other contestants, even without themselves suspecting it, would form a sort of
coalition against me, for to become Champion for the third time running would
be simply too much. The effusive Mark Taimanov even stated that if this should
be possible and should happen, he would give up chess. Thus, by not taking
first place at Tbilisi, I performed a good deed for chess... --- I arrived
late in Tbilisi. My first round game, against Taimanov as it happened, was
postponed. My first result in the table was the traditional nought, obtained
in my game with the young player Yukhtman, who played the Scotch Gambit
against me. In striving for more than equality, I at some stage overestimated
my chances, and came under an attack which my opponent conducted very
accurately. --- As I have already said, this type of defeat acts as a spur to
me, and in the next two rounds I defeated Polugaevsky and Geller, in two very
interesting games. --- Then came draws with Keres and Lutikov, and a win
against Krogius, whereupon I had to play Petrosian, who had begun the
tournament highly successfully, and was playing with great verve. Tbilisi was
after all the town where he had been born, and the town where he had grown up;
on his 'home ground' he very much wanted to win. As usual, he did not lose any
games, but he won more often than in, say, the Championship of the previous
year. However, our game was postponed due to his being unwell, and this
somehow affected me, for I realised that the encounter was very important in
the battle for the leaders' jersey. In the following round I received a most
unexpected stroke of fortune. The master Nezhmetdinov, who always played
against me with great relish, once again conducted the whole game splendidly,
and obtained a completely won position, but then made a bad blunder, and lost.
This victory did not give me any particular pleasure, and although I then
defeated Averbakh, I had the feeling that retribution was not far off. I even
appeared on Georgian television and said that I was unaccustomed to the idea
of being the potential leader after the tenth round, and that to be honest, I
was afraid it would not continue for long. --- That is exactly what happened;
retribution came the following day. Exploiting my over-active play, the young
player Gufeld, who had apparently always held me in respect and even a certain
trepidation, on this occasion was in a very aggressive mood. We castled on
opposite sides and I was happy about this until it became apparent that his
attack was developing significantly faster than mine. --- Some five rounds
before the finish, Petrosian and I played off our postponed game, which, like
the majority of the ones we had played previously, ended in a draw. The
decisive role, which ensured that in this Championship I essentially took no
part in the struggle for first place, was played by an episode which occurred
when the adjourned games were played off. --- At that point I had accumulated
three adjournments: against Gurgenidze, Vasiukov and Spassky. In the last I
had a certain, perhaps even decisive, positional advantage in the endgame, but
I fully appreciated that physically it would be simply impossible to analyse
all three positions, especially since in all three a hard fight was in
prospect.}) (1. -- {After finding out from a control colleague in what order I
would have to play off the games, and having made sure that, except in extreme
circumstances, the game with Spassky would be played off last, I considered it
my duty to warn Boris that I would do everything possible to ensure that our
game was not resumed that day. He fully understood my position, and agreed,
especially since he had only one game adjourned. --- We arrived for the
resumption. There was a slight complication in that Vasiukov, whose game with
me was due to be played off second, first had to play Lutikov. --- I sat down
against Gurgenidze, and apologised to my opponent, saying that I was going to
play very unhurriedly, since I did not want our game to end before Vasiukov
finished his game with Lutikov. --- With an unexpected move, which had been
found literally an hour before the resumption, I succeeded in quickly
obtaining a decisive advantage against Gurgenidze. --- I attempted not to
force matters, while maintaining my advantage, especially since in the
adjourned game with Vasiukov my knight was much stronger than his bishop, and
the character of the position was such that my knight could roam all round the
board before I had to undertake decisive action. Thus the possibility of the
game with Spassky being resumed appeared to be ruled out. --- Then Lutikov
reached a position with king, bishop and knight against Vasiukov's lone king.
I thought that their game would be over at any minute, so I forced matters,
and Gurgenidze resigned. But at this point Vasiukov, in his game against
Lutikov, continued calmly and imperturbably seeking the only legal move with
his king. The controllers waited for the customary 15 minutes, and then began
looking for Spassky, but he had taken me at my word, and had not arrived for
the resumption. The control team began discussing the matter. One of the
controllers suggested that the Lutikov-Vasiukov game should be interrupted,
but this would have meant helping Lutikov to find the winning method, although
only formally, since the strong master was well familiar with the technique of
mating with bishop and knight against a lone king, and it was Vasiukov who was
dragging things out. The formal point of view nevertheless prevailed. Spassky
was found somewhere, and we sat down to resume our game. It was not at all
surprising that within some 20 minutes I made a mistake, and now Spassky
gained the advantage. Even so, the game finished in a draw, which gave
Petrosian the chance to consolidate his position as leader. --- My traditional
loss to Korchnoi in the penultimate round allowed Petrosian to practically
assure himself of first place. In the final round all three contenders for the
medals drew their games. The result was gold for Petrosian, and silver for
Spassky and myself. --- Personally, I didn't feel that I could complain about
the result although, for some reason, it was considered by some that a share
of second and third places was practically a failure for me. --- Then I
returned to Riga where, within some four to six weeks, the Latvian Chess
Olympiad took place. The tournament was run on the Swiss System of which I had
the most unhappy memories, since three years previously I had suffered a
failure in such a tournament. In addition, I very much wanted my trainer,
Koblents, to take part in this tournament, since on the whole he appeared in
important events rather rarely. I did everything I could to talk him into it
and I even said that if we had to play each other, and I had White, then I
would offer him a draw in advance. I don't think that it was particularly
because of this, but, be that as it may, Koblents agreed to play. Starved of
tournament chess, he played with great relish, and after five rounds we had
drawn away from the other competitors, and headed the tournament table with
five points each. We naturally met in the sixth round, with Koblents having
White. A familiar situation, wouldn't you agree? Let anyone who has never in
his life acted in this way cast stones upon me, but if the Maestro had offered
me a draw before the game, it would have been instantly accepted. However,
Koblents kept quiet, and the game began in fairly serious fashion. I chose the
French Defence, with which I have never been particularly successful, and
obtained a dubious position, which around move 16-17 became lost, and everyone
realised this. At this point, when it was his turn to move, Koblents offered
me a draw. The position was such that he could himself force perpetual check,
or could slowly and surely convert his advantage into a win, or else he could
apparently win immediately, but here he would fall into a trap.}) (1. -- {I
could not agree to a draw in a lost position, since I have never been disposed
to accepting charity, and I thought to myself: 'If he is really offering me a
draw, then he will give perpetual check'. So I left it up to him to make the
choice. --- Such 'independence' on my part apparently annoyed my old colleague,
and after a few minutes' thought the Maestro very emotionally (outwardly at
any rate) carried out the winning combination. In doing so he fell into the
trap, about which I have already spoken, and soon an endgame, slightly
favourable for me, was reached. A draw could have been agreed, but now it was
I who felt offended: after all, the Maestro had spurned perpetual check. After
the game had been adjourned, contrary to tradition, we sat in opposite corners
of the hall, eating our sandwiches and analysing the same position, but
exchanging light-hearted comments. On resumption I managed to win around move
75. Koblents understood the course of my thoughts, and realised that I had
acted, as it were, according to the highest principles. --- Soon after this a
tournament began which was organised to celebrate the 150th Anniversary of the
Zurich Chess Club, one of the oldest in Europe. This was my first individual
international event, not connected with the battle for the World Championship.
I travelled to it with Grandmaster Keres, whose company I have always found
enjoyable and relaxing. Play came easily to me in Zurich, although in the
first round I suffered my 'traditional' defeat, on this occasion at the hands
of the Swiss master Bhend. Keres jokingly reassured me, saying that I had lost
to a player who was practically a compatriot. The point was that not long
before the tournament, at the International Festival for Young People and
Students in Moscow, Bhend had met a Russian girl and had married her. ---
After my initial misfortune, I succeeded in winning four games in a row in
fairly entertaining style, with tactical blows of the sort that so appeal to
fans. Incidentally, it was in Zurich that I first came across a system of
material stimulation for results. The prize-money awarded to the participants
for the number of points gained was unusual: in cash terms, two half-points
were not equivalent to the same point gained by means of a win and a loss. If
the many years have not affected my everyday memory - as yet I cannot complain
about my chess memory! - a draw was 'worth' 25 francs, and a win 60. There was
even a consolation of 10 francs for a defeat. --- I don't think that it was
this that so affected play, but there were very few draws, at any rate quiet
ones. Indeed the draw which everyone had predicted between Keres and Tal only
came after I succeeded in escaping from my opponent's highly unpleasant grip.
--- Then, in the seventh round, came a game which I enjoyed, as did the
spectators, and even, it would seem, my co-author Keller (see the following
game). I will give it without notes, since the variations left behind the
scenes are numerous and complicated.}) *

{In the last round, only a win could satisfy Fischer, but the game ended in a
draw, with, I would say, a moral victory to my opponent, who equalised quickly
as Black. Now only Gligoric could catch me, and for a further twenty moves he
tried to win an ending with rook and bishop against Kupper, who had a rook and
knight. Even so, this game also ended in a draw, and so Gligoric and I
finished up, as in the Interzonal Tournament, with half a point between us.
Fischer shared 3rd and 4th places with Keres, and he began to be talked about
more and more. --- So, everything seemed fine. We returned home to join the
Latvian team, which was preparing somewhere by the sea in Riga for the USSR
Peoples' Spartakiad, when I had my first attack of kidney trouble. The doctors
were unable to say anything definite immediately, but suggested that in any
case I shouldn't play in the Spartakiad. I realised that it would not be easy
for me there on top board against Botvinnik, Spassky, Geller, Keres,
Boleslavsky and others, but I decided that my participation would to some
extent help the team. Although I took last place (for the first time in my
life!) in the team leaders' tournament, scoring 2½ out of 8, I nevertheless
succeeded in saving a few points for our team in analysis, so that the lads
considered that I had been justified in playing. --- I realised, as early as
the preliminary group, that I could not hope for much. I had only just
sacrificed a knight on g7 against Keres, when I had a recurrence of the attack,
and straight away the game ceased to be of interest. The following day exactly
the same happened, and I am still sorry about this game: it could have been
one of my best. Here is the second half of it, Spassky was White.} 23... f6 $1

JOURNALIST. I recall that 10 years ago, you said that you were intending to
play it every time you sat down at the board. --- CHESS PLAYER. Did I? Well,
in principle that's true. Only, nowadays I would say: 'today I may play my
best game', and not 'I must play'. After these encounters I restrained my
appetite for chess, trying to equate my needs with my possibilities.
Nevertheless, I prepared carefully for the first game in my life with
Botvinnik. However, instead of him, the Moscow reserve Vasiukov turned out and,
as a result of this, it was Smyslov who suffered 'on the rebound'. I was
expecting Botvinnik to play the Caro-Kann Defence, and the position which
Smyslov and I were to reach in the second cycle of the coming Candidates
Tournament in Yugoslavia was already standing on a board in one of the rooms
of the skyscraper 'Ukraine' hotel, during the Spartakiad in Moscow. --- In all
the remaining games from the Spartakiad, except one, I quickly agreed a draw,
but I lost to my old 'enemy' Nezhmetdinov at the very moment when, in a
slightly better position, I decided that it was time to win something back.
The rest is understandable. --- After the Spartakiad in Moscow, the usual open
lightning championship of the city took place for the prize donated by the
newspaper Vechernaya Moskva. I already had experience of lightning tournaments
and readily played in them, not unsuccessfully. On this occasion, in the heat
of the battle - and a tournament of five-minute games with 24 participants
lasts for about 6 hours - I had a new attack. --- After losing some ten games,
and dissipating the whole of my plus score, I took a flight to Riga, and
within 2 hours was already in one of the clinics there. --- The next morning
they operated on me, and took out... my appendix. The most amusing thing is
that, for several years after this, my attacks of kidney trouble ceased (!),
and I found out that the first operation had been ineffective only when I had
my diseased kidney removed. --- I was allowed 10 days to recover, not by my
doctors, but by the International Chess Federation: the Candidates Tournament
in Yugoslavia was about to start. --- My friends arranged for my luggage to be
taken to the airport, and then Grandmaster Averbakh (at first he was my only
second; Koblents arrived somewhat later) and I, together with Keres, Petrosian,
Smyslov and their seconds, set off for Bled. --- I was not much troubled by
the effects of the operation, apart from in a purely mechanical sense; during
a game I did not feel inclined to stroll about, and I was unable to walk
quickly. I was able to devote myself to the battle, and in round one the first
game of my life against Smyslov was adjourned in a position that I considered
drawn, despite the fact that I was the exchange down. Then I won against
Gligoric, and after this I played Keres, not even suspecting that the result
of this meeting could be of great significance. Who thought that it was the
future winners who were playing? --- In this encounter I at first succeeded in
outwitting my formidable opponent in tactical complications, but then,
rejecting the simple in favour of the complex, I first of all gave up my
advantage, and then lost the game.}) 1-0

{Taking into account the loss of my adjourned game against Smyslov, my
tournament position - one point out of three - was not very prepossessing,
especially since my failure against Keres had been rather annoying. --- Our
game had apparently so exhausted Keres that the following day he played
passively and lost against Petrosian, who thus became the leader. As White
against me, Petrosian did not force matters, and after defeating the remaining
foreign contestants, I finished the first cycle amongst the leaders. --- The
second cycle went roughly the same way, except that, in addition, I succeeded
in winning a game against Smyslov that was important for my frame of mind. As
you will recall, it was here that exploded the mine intended for Botvinnik in
the USSR Peoples' Spartakiad. However, the attack itself, and the sacrifices
in this game - which won the brilliancy prize - were pure improvisation. ---
The game provoked a great deal of interest (it is given here), and every
morning for at least three weeks the leader of our delegation, Grandmaster
Ragozin, would exchange variations with the well-known Yugoslav journalist,
master Vukovic. --- Vukovic would come up with a refutation of the combination,
and Ragozin, the next day, would respond with an improvement for the attack.
In the end they came to the conclusion that White had sufficient pressure for
the piece. --- Such play so appealed to me, that I decided: everything is
possible! A couple of days later, in my game with Keres I suddenly saw a
fantastic possibility of sacrificing two pieces: a knight on b6, and a bishop
on d6. I carried out the plan, ran up against a simple refutation, and
continued to resist, prompted only by emotion, since I could have resigned

{However, my optimism remained high, since I considered that I had been
unfairly punished for an original idea. After a further three wins in a row,
it was clear after the end of the second cycle that if nothing extraordinary
happened then either Keres or I would be the winner. The tournament moved on
to Zagreb, but before this, a lightning event was held in Bled. I succeeded in
winning it, but what sticks in my mind is something else: a unique oversight.
I cannot recall the exact position, but the mechanism of the blunder was as
follows: It was Black to move. Averbakh offered me a draw, but I decided to
play on. I saw that I had to defend against the threat of 2 Bxh7+ and 3 Qxd5.
So I defended by} 1... h6 $4 {. As you will have guessed, Averbakh replied} 2.
Bh7+ {, and didn't offer a draw again. --- I will jump ahead a little. During
the Candidates Tournament, two further lightning events were held. I took
first place in both of them - in one, after a playoff match with Matulovic.
Before the play-off Matulovic demanded that we should share the prize,
irrespective of the result. I did not object, although the prize that the
organizers had put forward was a single air-rifle. In addition. it was not of
the double-barrelled variety. --- I began the third cycle sharing 2nd-3rd
places with Petrosian, but it was already clear that Tigran was fading a
little. As usual, he underestimated his chances, and was clearly happy to
fight for a place not higher than an honourable third. --- From this cycle I
must again recall in particular the games with Smyslov and Keres (the
encounter with Fischer is given here). In the first of these my opponent was
obviously intent on gaining his revenge for the game from the second cycle,
and besides, it was clear that the players from the older generation who were
fighting for the crown did not especially want to allow a young upstart into
their midst. --- Up to a certain point Smyslov played the game brilliantly and
completely outplayed me, while in addition I had only 2-3 minutes left for
some 15 moves. I had nothing to lose, there was no time for hesitation, and I
attempted only to complicate my opponent's task in any way possible. Then,
with my flag horizontal, and a further four moves still to make, Smyslov ran
into almost the only 'swindle' I had managed to think up. As I later found out,
he had seen my rook sacrifice on g1, but not on h1. --- Smyslov is normally
imperturbable at the board, but here, after my 39th move ...Rh1+, his face
changed, and after thinking for some three minutes, he made his reply and
slammed his clock with furious force. Some of the pieces fell over, but,
contrary to my normal practice, I first gave check with my rook on g1, pressed
my clock, and only then began to restore order on the board. White could no
longer escape from perpetual check. --- On the same day, Keres blundered in
his game with Fischer, and I drew level with Paul Petrovich, and then after
the next round, when I won against Gligoric, I went into the lead for the
first time. --- The next game, with Keres, thus took on an even greater
significance. Before going in for some forced complications my opponent
offered me a draw. I recalled the two games I had already lost to him in the
tournament, and besides, I was-playing Black, and was leading him by half a
point. Thus a draw was desirable on all accounts, except one: the position was
highly interesting and I did not want to part with it. --- The subsequent play
was very lively, and although I got into time-trouble (by the way, when I am
in form, I even now do not worry about the consequences of time-trouble), I
managed to win.} *

{JOURNALIST. In the majority of cases you decline when you are offered a draw.
Do you take time to consider the suggestion, or, like a charger, do you
straight away 'snort' defiance at the sound of the bugle? --- CHESS PLAYER.
Alas, that is normally what happens. I will even let you into a small 'trade
secret'. When I am offered a draw around move 15, while the position is still
'flavourless', and there is no real fight going on, then I am more inclined to
agree, but later I more often decline. --- So, the third cycle went highly
successfully for me: a part from the draw with Smyslov I shared the point only
with Petrosian, and won the rest of my games. I am now prepared to admit that
in the 3rd and 4th cycles Petrosian and I did not really play. This was a
negative reaction to the practically unanimous comments in the press after our
game from the second cycle. We had played seriously but then read the
following opinion, which was not exactly complimentary to us: 'Of course, Tal
and Petrosian are friends; there is nothing one can do about it, all their
games finish in a draw'. This angered us, and we decided: 'Right, we'll show
them how to really draw without a fight!' Over our next game we spent a total
of 5 minutes, not more. --- I set off for the fourth cycle in Belgrade with a
lead of 1½ points. Taking into account the fact that in my two most
important games, with Smyslov and Keres, I had White, I assumed that this lead
should suffice. --- However, I am unable to win a tournament without any
adventures. They began with the game against Smyslov, where I needlessly threw
myself into the attack, ran up against an excellent defence, then
half-blundered, half-sacrificed a piece, and only in the time-scramble managed
to win after a blunder by my opponent on the 40th move. --- In the following
round Smyslov was this time 'on my side', and defeated Keres, and since I won
against Gligoric, I was leading by 2½ points with five rounds to go. I had
only to draw with my closest pursuer Keres, who at that moment was already
resigned to taking second place, and victory was in the bag. I realized this
perfectly well, but as White nevertheless decided to attempt, if possible, to
make the score in our individual match 2-2. Here I found out, for the first
time in my life, that to play simultaneously for two results (no one plays
deliberately for a loss, as far as I am aware) is not possible. I began with
the intention of playing a complicated positional five-hour game, but then a
couple of times I had a certain change of heart, and Keres very keenly sensed
this indecision on my part. From around move 15, he himself began playing for
a win. From inertia I avoided exchanges on a couple of moves, and when I made
up my mind to play only for a draw, it proved to be too late. This win gained
Keres the prize for the 'Best Game'. --- Two rounds later, the distance
between us had narrowed to one point, and in the penultimate round I had to
play the quite revitalised Fischer, who up till then had capitulated in all
our three games. Afterwards I was told that Bobby had sworn in public to at
least exact his revenge at the finish, so as to have the last word. --- In
preparing for the game we decided that I should play the normal Sicilian
Defence with ...d6 and ...a6, and as regards the sacrifice of White's e-pawn,
we carelessly waved our hands and said 'Oh, take it!' So I took it, although I
was unprepared, subsequently made a couple of mistakes, and felt myself to be
on the very, very edge of the abyss. Especially since Fischer was playing very
keenly and accurately, while Keres, 'scenting blood', had as Black set himself
to do everything he could to crush Gligoric. In short, everything pointed to
the fact that the question of first place would be decided in the last round,
or even after it. --- However Fischer, not wishing to remain a pawn down for
long, hastened to re-establish material equality, and in doing so lost a part
of his advantage. On the 18th move I was faced with a choice: I could either
go into a slightly inferior ending, or else I could accept a piece sacrifice,
thereby subjecting myself to a very strong attack. I could not see a forced
mate, it is true, but perhaps only because I wasn't looking for one. If I had
been playing White, I would have considered the attack to be decisive. ---
Nevertheless, I chose the second path, and within three moves the following
famous position was reached. --- It is famous, because it was here that a
widely-known psychological duel took place between us. --- Every player has
his own habit: one will first make his move and then write it down, while
another will do wings the other way round. Incidentally, in recent years
Fischer has actively objected to this 'other way round', expressing the
opinion that a scoresheet is not a black-board for writing down exercises.} 22.
-- ({However, in our game Fischer first wrote down the move} 22. Rae1 $1 {,
without doubt the strongest, and wrote it not in his usual English notation
but in European, almost Russian! Then he not very deftly pushed the scoresheet
towards me. 'He's asking for an endorsement', I thought to myself, but how was
I to react? To frown was impossible, if I smiled he would suspect 'trickery',
and so I did the natural thing. I got up and began to calmly walk up and down
the stage. I met Petrosian, made some joke to him, and he replied. The
15-year-old Fischer, who was essentially still only a large child, sat with a
confused expression on his face, looking first at the front row of the
spectators where his second was sitting, and then at me.}) ({Then he wrote
down another move:} 22. Qc6+ $2 {, and after} Rd7 23. Rae1+ Be7 24. Rxf7 Kxf7
25. Qe6+ Kf8 $1 26. Qxd7 Qd6 {, I held on to my extra piece and adjourned the
game in a won position. When I later asked Fischer why he hadn't played 22
Rae1, he replied: 'Well, you laughed when I wrote it down!'}) (22. -- {After
this, my second made me give my word to offer a draw in the last round on move
12. At that time my score against Benko was 5-0, and the idea that he might
refuse the draw somehow never occurred to me.}) (22. -- {JOURNALIST.
Especially after the performance with the glasses? --- CHESS PLAYER. Yes, of
course! In the third cycle, when we sat down at the board Benko, who had
earlier suspected me of hypnotising him, took out of his pocket a pair of dark
glasses and put them on. This 'innovation', like any that the opponent knows
about beforehand, was met by a 'counter-stroke'. I had borrowed some enormous
dark glasses from Petrosian, and following Benko I straight away put them on.
Not only the spectators laughed, as well as the other participants and the
controllers, but also Benko himself. Unlike me, however, he did not remove his
glasses until as late as the twentieth move, by which time his position was
already hopeless. --- So in the last round, after playing g4 on my 12th move,
I kept my word and offered a draw. Benko silently made an answering move, very
quickly blundered, and got into a lost position. On the 21st move I could
either give perpetual check, or else go into a completely won ending with two
extra pawns. --- I gave perpetual check, and with the quick temper of youth
explained my decision to the journalists as follows: 'When I want to win
against Benko, I win; when I want to draw - I draw'. Today I can only request
indulgence, taking into account the fact that I was then only 22 years old,
but I should say that from the psychological point of view it would have been
easier for Benko if I had won that game... --- Only after this, on the
initiative of the journalists, did I begin thinking about the match with
Botvinnik. --- Before the match there was one more tournament: the first
International Tournament in Riga, held under the slogan 'The Baltic is the sea
of friendship'.}) (22. -- {JOURNALIST. But was it sensible for you to play in
it? After all, there was less than six months to go before the match. ---
CHESS PLAYER. In the first place, it would have been rather awkward for me to
decline to take part in Riga. Secondly, Koblents and I decided that I should
try to 'cover up' in the opening, especially as Black against 1 d4. In
addition, Koblents set me a purely 'academic' task: to play somewhat passively
in the opening, so as to become accustomed to defending. --- This was the
general aim. We did not set a goal as far as the result was concerned, and it
is doubtful whether this would have helped, for the winners, Spassky and
Mikenas, played very, very well. A certain consolation was provided by the
prize for the best attack in the tournament (this game with Johannessen is
given here) and my result in the traditional lightning tournament: 16½ out
of 17. --- Of course, I am only joking. Seriously speaking we were happy with
the creative results of the tournament as one of the steps in our preparations
for the match. --- I spent the last few days of the year in Vilnius, and I
could not decline an invitation from our Lithuanian neighbours to give a
simultaneous display, where I was confronted by almost entirely first category
players. The display concluded with an honourable result for me: +19 -1 =6.
--- Then the year 1960 arrived, but before leading the conversation on to the
two matches for the World Championship, in which I happened to be a
participant, I should like to tell you about an episode from the distant past.
It is about how M. Tal was sent out of the class. --- Autumn 1945: A singing
lesson for the 5th year of the 77th Riga school. Behind one of the desks, two
boys are intently turning over the pages of the chess bulletin 14th USSR
Championship (this was my first encounter with chess literature). --- The
'studying' proceeded according to the principle: the less comprehensible, the
better, since symbols such as e4, Nf5 etc. were at that time like some kind of
hieroglyphics to me. However, one thing was perfectly clear: there was a
string of 'ones' against the name of Botvinnik. Carried away by what we were
doing, we made perhaps the first blunder of our chess careers: we 'overlooked'
a question by the teacher. The retribution was swift and severe. --- All my
generation -lads who had first learned chess in the immediate post-war years -
had their idol. He was, of course, Mikhail Moiseyevich Botvinnik. Many were
supporters of Keres, many wished Smyslov success, but they, and others,
admired the first Soviet World Champion. --- In 1948 I also achieved some
success in the field of chess - I reached fourth category rating. It is very
possible that I played a little worse then than I do now, but my
self-importance was no less. When, in May, Botvinnik was proclaimed World
Champion, I was truly delighted, and yet somewhere inside of me there was a
slight doubt: how could this be, after all he had never played me?! --- Years
passed. Schoolboys became students, fourth category players become candidate
masters, but the idol remained the same. I must repeat that until the last
round of the 1959 Candidates Tournament, the idea that I would at some time be
playing a match for the World Championship with Botvinnik never entered my
head. Now the moment had arrived.}) *

{In making judgements about chess, many people are in the habit of taking into
account only tournament or match-play where the players sit opposite one
another and endeavour to gain a victory in their combat within five hours.
However, a tournament encounter is only one of a variety of chess art-forms.
Analysis of opening variations, chess compositions, correspondence chess, and
many other elements must be considered when we talk about the art of chess as
a single unit. --- I have permitted myself this introduction in order to
emphasise the thoughts that overtook me at the beginning of last year. The
well-known Stockholm newspaper 'Dagens Nyheter' invited me to play a game by
telegraph with the Swedish Grandmaster Stoltz. --- If I had declined this
invitation I would have lost the joy of taking part in a game against a player
with an interesting, sharp, combinative style (let me remind the reader that
the Swedish grandmaster has won many beauty prizes for tournament games). I
would also have missed trying out my powers in a thoroughly strange field.
Correspondence chess is different from other chess forms in certain
characteristic respects. A player is not handicapped by the same time-control 
(although in correspondence chess there is occasionally a time forfeit in fact,
through the fault of the postal service) and he can calmly analyse the
developing position in domestic surroundings undisturbed by the 'Sword of
Damocles' on the chess clock. --- In order to give as true as possible a
picture of the contest, I have used telegrams received from Stockholm and a
diary written on the specified day. --- 22nd March: A telegram received from
Stockholm with the suggestion of playing this game. Simultaneously a newspaper
proposed that the opponents choose their opening variation to make the game as
interesting as possible. What should I choose? After a little thought I
decided on one of the sharpest Sicilian Defence variations. And so the duel of
the correspondence game has begun.} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6

the pawn on a2, because he would be in danger of losing the knight. Should

1. d4 Nf6 {Despite his youth the American Champion is very conservative in his
choice of the openings. Playing with White he plays only O. Bender's
recognised move e4, and with Black he operates only with the Sicilian or
King's Indian systems. Preparation against an opponent like this is not
difficult. However, it is interesting to note that Fischer has prepared this
narrow repertoire very well. Many chess players were surprised when after the
game Fischer quietly explained: 'I had already analysed this possibility' - in
a position which I thought was not possible to foresee from the opening. For
this game I borrowed the Petrosian system: on the surface very peaceful, but
with a large 'dose of poison'. The opening was played very quickly. --- Note:
Tal is alluding to a well known Russian chess story. Ostap Bender, an
extremely weak chess player, arrived in the small town of Vasyuki and
announced that he would give a lecture followed by a simultaneous exhibition
at the Cardboard-Workers' Club. By describing himself as a Grandmaster, Bender
persuaded many townsfolk to pay to watch or to participate in his exhibition.
On each of the thirty boards he opened 1 e4 and each game ended in his defeat.
At the end of the 'exhibition', Bender rushed out into the street and escaped
in a waiting boat.} 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Be2 {An innocent move,

Knowing the United States Champion to be a player with chess principles (not
to say dogmas), I had no doubt that one of the variations of the King's Indian
Defence would be played in our game from the third cycle. It will not be out
of place to recall that the majority of Fischer's defeats in the Candidates
Tournament were the result of him repeating the same, and to a considerable
extent, inferior opening systems. Of course, one cannot place an opening such
as the King's Indian Defence in such a category, but from the results of this
tournament it can be concluded that Grandmaster Petrosian, possibly without
himself realising it, has placed King's Indian players in a very difficult
position. If I remember correctly, he first adopted this system in his game
with Suetin from the 25th USSR Championship, when he spoke very modestly about
its value, saying that its main advantage was that Black did not obtain active
play. Many games have now been played with this system. Black indeed does not
obtain active play, but White does, and what play!} h6 9. Bh4 a6 ({The

the author of the system, Petrosian, in his game with Gligoric from the final
round. --- In the present game Fischer chooses the most dogmatic, but also
very slow, continuation, involving the exchange of the dark-squared bishops.
This continuation, I recall, was recommended by Grandmaster Averbakh in an
article devoted to the tournament in Portoroz, and one must suppose, for this
reason, that it was familiar to me. After the game it was revealed that the

{Soon after my return from Yugoslavia, I met Botvinnik in the Grandmaster room
of the Central Chess Club, and we began 'discussing' the conditions for the
match. I have put the word in inverted commas, because at that time, although
I had behind me some experience of match play (against Saigin in 1954), I
nevertheless did not expect that it would all be taken so seriously. There was
in fact no discussion between us, and indeed, there could not be; I fully
relied on Botvinnik's experience, and the majority of the details of our
meeting have slipped my memory. I recall just one point: the World Champion
persistently argued the necessity for having two envelopes when a game was
adjourned, so that the loss of one (and such a thing can happen even in a
World Championship Match) would not be so serious. --- Two envelopes - that
means two scoresheets, on each of which one has to write down a secret move 
(preferably the same one on each sheet), and since at that time (and even now)
I could not cope with carbon paper, the whole procedure of the sealed move
seemed to me to be made doubly crucial (perhaps because of this, in our first
match I had only to fill in the envelopes - it was always Botvinnik who sealed)
. --- It is both pleasant and complicated to recall the 1960 match. Why it is
pleasant, the reader will, of course, realise perfectly well; the difficulty
lies in the fact that all that I can say concerning it has evidently been
written in my book on the match. Nowadays I sometimes turn over the pages of
this book, and try to establish to what extent it was written by a youthful
hand (to express it somewhat delicately). At any rate, my next book about a
match for the World Championship will be more 'adult'. --- I have to admit to
the reader that my frame of mind prior to the first game was not particularly
optimistic; there was good reason for this. The fact was that in the preceding
years I had developed the 'nice' habit of beginning a tournament with a loss.
The 25th USSR Championship, the International Tournament in Zurich, the USSR
Peoples' Spartakiad, and finally the Candidates Tournament - I think that this
list is quite sufficient. Besides, this had become so ingrained in me, that
the result of the first game did not come as a surprise either to me, to my
opponent, who turned up for the game to receive his 'due' point, or to my
friends, who began listening to chess reports and buying bulletins only after
the second round.} 1. -- {One of my friends (I don't know whether he was being
serious) suggested that I should simply not turn up for the start of the match,
but should join in at the second game. Who knows, I might have followed his
advice had it not been for an old story which accidentally impressed itself on
my mind. It is well known that in train crashes it is the rear coaches that
come off worst. At a meeting where the question of eliminating the cause of
such calamities was being discussed, a wise old signal operator suggested:
let's just uncouple the last coach, and let the train go without it. As you
can see, these two solutions are almost equally profound... --- No doubt
because of this, we arrived in Moscow on time. If there had been some
discussion as to whether to begin the first game at all, how to begin it we
knew beforehand. At the conclusion of the Candidates Tournament in Belgrade, a
Yugoslav radio commentator had asked me: 'What will you play on the first move
of your first game with Botvinnik?, I then promised to begin by moving my
e-pawn, and, of course, I did not want to break my word for no special reason;
besides, the move 1 e4 is not bad in itself. --- The match began very well for
me. Koblents and I had guessed which opening variation the World Champion
would choose, and although Botvinnik had prepared an innovation, I was well
familiar with the character of the position. I won after a short, sharp
skirmish. After the seventh game my lead had increased to three points, but
the chess content of our games in no way corresponded to the results. --- The
positional advantage gained by Botvinnik as a result of deep, well-thought-out
play, was in many cases beyond dispute, and only time-trouble errors, and, to
a greater extent, excessive caution in time-trouble, told on the result. ---
Sensing this disparity, I played the eighth game, I would say, excessively
recklessly: if I was going to be punished it would serve me right, while if
chess injustice was to triumph once again - well, as compensation I would have
one more point.} *

{At first the eighth game developed along familiar lines. By move 15 Botvinnik
had a positional advantage, by move 20 an extra pawn, and by move 25 both the
one and the other. However, by move 30 the position had become significantly
sharper. After a further few inaccurate moves on White's part, the following
position was reached: Amazed by his good fortune, Black confidently made what
he thought was the winning move} 34... Rbc8 {. There was no time to be amazed

reached the position given in the diagram, and almost immediately various
unrepeatable words were uttered. We had both noticed that, by continuing 34...Rec8 instead of 34...Rbc8, Black would have won instantly. It is hardly worth
mentioning the fact that I never closed my eyes that night. Forgotten were all
the 'presents' received earlier; my heart was tortured by the thought of this
scandalous injustice. Early next morning there was a knock at my door, and my
second came in. It was clear that he too had not slept well. Smiling, he
extracted from his briefcase some fresh tomatoes and a cucumber. We
breakfasted, phoned a few friends, and went for a walk around Moscow. Then I
dropped in for a moment to the chess club, made sure that Botvinnik had sealed
41 Nf7+, and in the evening we went to the theatre. (For a long time I was
reluctant to talk about this incident, although I am sure that it demonstrates
very clearly the mastery of Koblents as a trainer.)}) *

{The following game, the ninth, was Botvinnik's best achievement in the match.
In his preparations he had succeeded in rendering harmless an apparently very
dangerous piece sacrifice, and at the board he exploited my positional errors
with meticulous accuracy. The middle third of the match was extremely hard
fought, and its result (+ 1 -1 =6) fully reflects the character of the
struggle. Here fatigue was beginning to have its effect (grandmaster draws in
the 13th and 14th games), while a change of opening from 1 e4 brought me
success in the 11th game. During this time the two perhaps most interesting
drawn games were played (the 10th and 12th). --- Despite the difference of two
points after the 16th game, it was not at all easy to predict the result of
the match. It was without doubt the seventeenth game which proved decisive,
for once again I 'sowed', and should have 'reaped', but a fatal blunder by
Botvinnik in time-trouble led to the World Champion's defeat. By winning the
19th, which is my favourite game from the match, I succeeded in increasing my
lead to 4 points.} 1. c4 f5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. d4 d6 6. Nc3 e6

{JOURNALIST. This is the game that you like the most, but which move do you
remember best of all from this, the most important match of your life? ---
CHESS PLAYER. I think the 12th move of the seventeenth game, which I have
already mentioned.} 12. f4 $6 {'Horrible', 'anti-positional', 'unbelievable'
etc., etc. - this is how all the commentators, without exception, described
this last move by White. One might think that the player with White was
completely unfamiliar with any elementary book on chess, where it is written
in black and white that one really can't make a move such as 12 f4, since it
weakens the dark squares, leaves the bishop at g5 out of play, and puts in
jeopardy the already compromised position of the white king. I don't think
that the reader will consider me immodest, if I say that all these
considerations concerned me during the game. Nevertheless, the fact remains:
the horrible move 12 f4 was made. Why? I will now try to briefly explain the
course of my thoughts during the eight minutes that I spent over my 12th move.
I first of all established that White has no trace of an opening advantage.} ({
Nevertheless, by} 12. Qd2 {White could have steered the ship towards the
drawing haven, which would probably not have been far off. Although it may
sound silly, during such an important game I suddenly began to be bothered by
the question: 'Will my wife and I manage to get to the cinema or theatre?'}) ({
In fact White has little choice in this position: his bishop is attacked and
any retreat by it is inconsistent; the exchange on f6 is devoid of any
positional sense, defending the bishop by Qc1 is very passive, and the move} 
12. f4 {is simply bad. Thus it is the drawbacks to all the possible moves
which are most apparent. Finally my wandering gaze settled on the move 12 f4.
At first I became somehow embarrassed, for the drawbacks to this move are more
obvious than to any other one, although in the given position there is no move
without its drawbacks. Less apparent are the advantages of this move, but they
do exist, although not in a purely chess sense. In the first place, the move
'demands a refutation' which should be accompanied by the possibility of a
double-edged, tactical struggle, and this, to judge by Botvinnik's style in
the match, would be undesirable for him. Secondly, the weakening of White's
position can only be exploited by an undermining of the centre, and after
moves such as ...c5 or ...e5 the power of the white bishops will be
significantly increased. Finally, Black can attack White's kingside only by
castling queenside, but then White can set in motion his queenside pawn mass.
Perhaps Black should simply have replied} O-O {, but this is after all not a
refutation.}) *

{JOURNALIST. And Botvinnik's best move? --- CHESS PLAYER. Probably the 23rd
move in his best game, the ninth. --- The apparently modest move} 23... Rf8 $3
{enabled Black to carry out the manoeuvre ...Ng4 and...Ndf6, after which it
became clear that the black piece was stronger than the three white pawns.
However, I have already mentioned this earlier. I will add that Botvinnik went
on to win on the 58th move. --- Shortly after the match there was an
interesting friendly match in Hamburg between the USSR and West Germany. At
that time I was an object of enhanced interest to the press, but to be honest,
this had never particularly bothered me, and I soon became accustomed to it.
And the match was also significant for the fact that, for the first time, I
officially began to smoke. --- I made my first contact with cigarettes during
the Candidates Tournament. As you will recall, I made a poor start and for a
short time I became depressed and my post-operation stitches began to pull
unpleasantly. Here, one of the journalists, after making a professional
assessment of my condition, offered me a cigarette. I tried one, it worked,
and I even liked it. I took to smoking in my room, and since I finished in
first place I did not think about the harmful effects of tobacco. At home I
systematically began to 'borrow' the odd couple of cigarettes from my uncle.
During the match with Botvinnik I was already smoking openly, but for some
reason not during the game - I didn't feel I wanted to. On the way to Hamburg
I warned my fellow smokers Geller and Tolush that if I should show any
weakness during play and ask them for a cigarette, they should refuse to give
me one. --- Then came the first game, against Lehmann. Round about move five
he put his hand into his pocket, brought out a cigar, and began puffing away
at it. I held out for another ten moves, but then the board began to rock
slightly in front of me. 'In search of counterplay' I turned to Geller and
Tolush, but they simply spread their hands: 'Misha, you yourself asked us not
to give you any'. --- I dashed into the bar and bought a packet of untipped
'Camel'. Since there is a saying that you are not a smoker if you smoke other
people's cigarettes, but only if you smoke your own, it was in Hamburg that I
became a smoker. --- In general I was happy with the way the match went. The
spectators followed me intently, and, encouraged by their interest, I had but
one draw in eight games.} (23... -- {JOURNALIST. By the way, how in general
are famous players affected by their surroundings? --- CHESS PLAYER. Here
everything depends on the individual. Fischer, for instance, is abnormally
sensitive to the slightest noise in the hall, but it is very difficult to sit
watching in the hall without stirring, and without exchanging opinions with
your neighbour. I myself am sometimes a spectator, and I know that it is so.
Therefore I understand perfectly well how Fischer, Botvinnik, and many others
players find it very difficult to force themselves to concentrate fully, one
hundred per cent, under such conditions. --- Then there are other players,
among them Spassky, Korchnoi and myself. For us it is simply boring to play in
an empty hall. When we appear on the stage, we are artistes. The only
difference is that chess has its own specific form. You yourself are the
composer of the 'song', you are the singer, and you are the critic, and a very
harsh critic, because you wish without fail to refute the ideas and plans of
your 'fellow composer'. --- When we are playing and there is a hum in the hall,
some of us are annoyed, justifiably so, for it is indeed somewhat distracting.
With me it is just the opposite, provided only that I am in good form. When
things are not working out for me I also get annoyed. I am probably a little
jealous if the spectators react noisily to a move made on a neighbouring board
or by my opponent, and not by me. Then I notice that there is a noise in the
hall. When I am in good form, it is not a noise, but a reaction from the hall.
Something altogether different! --- The remainder of the year, from September
onwards, was spent resting, during which time I worked on my book about the
match with Botvinnik. --- During the Olympiad in Leipzig there was also a
happy event: my son was born. --- At the Olympiad my play was, on the whole,
successful. The game with Fischer is given here, and I gained the impression
that it was only after this encounter that he began to 'respect' me.}) (23...
-- {JOURNALIST. How did it happen that it was in this Olympiad that you were
second in the tournament on your board, and failed to win it? --- CHESS PLAYER.
Indeed, it was Robatsch who won, playing in the second final group. I deprived
myself of first place in the final round. This is how it happened. The
Olympiad ended on the day before my birthday and I wanted to be free at the
finish. Therefore I agreed with my fellow team members to play through the
'middlegame' of the Olympiad without a break. However, the day before the last
round, for strictly private reasons, the captain of our team asked me to play.
I 'threatened' him that I would lose, and I carried out my threat, although
God knows, I didn't want to. It was just that the English master Penrose
played the whole game very well. --- It turned out that the Olympiad did not
conclude my chess year. When I returned to Riga it was suddenly suggested that
I should playa radio match with the strongest young players from
Czechoslovakia. At first I readily agreed, but later I regretted this somewhat
- after all, to play on 20 boards against present-day Grandmasters such as
Hort, Jansa and their colleagues demanded time, and preparations had to be
made for the return match with Botvinnik. After travelling to Prague to
conclude the radio match, I ceased to regret it, this time for good: the trip
proved to be most pleasurable and entertaining. Besides, it was not without
its amusing little misunderstandings, caused by the fact that our intermediary,
a correspondent of Czech radio in Moscow, had only a very sketchy knowledge of
chess. Thus, for instance, in one of the games, after 1 e4 e5, I sent the move
2 Nf3, and in reply received the suggestion that I take it back. If I were to
insist on it, my youthful opponent courteously warned me, then on 2 f3(???) he
would play 2...Bc5. --- Nevertheless, I think that the two sides were about
equally satisfied with the score of + 11 =9. --- Then came a small New Year
Tournament in Stockholm, one of the steps in my preparations for the match.}) (
23... -- {JOURNALIST. Botvinnik considered this appearance of yours to be
unnecessary and ill-advised. --- CHESS PLAYER. On that basis, the same could
have been said about the tournament in Riga before our first match. The point
is, most probably, that the winner is not criticised whereas the loser is
always wrong. True, Koblents and I never considered ourselves to be
specialists in the art of preparation. --- The Stockholm tournament was not
one of my most difficult, although its short length made it all the more
important not to lose. The game against Unzicker is given here, and the
analysis of my adjourned game with Book was of interest (see the following
game).}) *

which, it is true, came after the finish of the tournament, was a recurrence
of kidney colic in Moscow, just before the flight to Prague. At first it was
bearable but I returned from Prague under medical supervision after lying
there in hospital for several days. From Prague they even sent their medical
diagnosis to Moscow, whereupon our Chess Federation began considering the
question of deferring the match. I was asked to send a letter to the President
of FIDE with preliminary evidence from a doctor commissioned by my opponent.
To me this all seemed to be very complicated and rather insulting, and I
preferred to play. Besides, my participation in the first match had itself
given me enormous satisfaction, and I was even waiting impatiently for the
second encounter. --- When I meet chess fans, I often have to answer a
ticklish question: what do you think of return matches? As it happened, the
honour of 'closing this page of FIDE' fell to my lot. What would it have cost
the International Chess Federation to take the decision to abolish return
matches a year earlier?! --- I had no doubt that Botvinnik would utilise his
right to a return match. There was also no justification for doubting that he
would be excellently prepared, especially after his splendid performance at
the Olympiad in Leipzig. Not long before the start of this, we once again met
in Moscow to discuss the conditions for the match. On this occasion there was
indeed a discussion - I had after all become more intractable by a year. In
particular, the question of where the return match was to be held was heatedly
discussed. In Riga they very much wanted to see, if not the whole event, then
at least half of it. One of the points in the regulations announced by FIDE 
(in 1960; subsequently I somehow never came across them again) was that the
match should take place in the World Champion's home country. --- Botvinnik,
on the other hand, expressed the following point of view: the return match
should, as far as possible, be an exact copy of the first match, though of
course it was not essential that the result should be the same. Since we were
unable to come to an agreement, we decided to ask the opinion of the FIDE
President F. Rogard. Unfortunately, I arrived a few days late in Leipzig (not
long before this, the car in which I was travelling to the Crimea skidded into
a ditch, and a wheel and two ribs were damaged), and during this period Mr
Rogard had had time to listen to my opponent, agree with him, and depart. ---
So once again it was Moscow in the spring. The controllers were our charming
old friends Stahlberg and Golombek, while Euwe also arrived for the start. The
draw was held in the 'National' hotel, and on the following day the first game
was played, with Botvinnik White. --- The character of the first game showed
that my opponent was in every way excellently prepared for the match. From the
opening Black obtained a very good game. Despite the early exchange of queens,
the position reached was of a clearly middlegame character, but the then World
Champion decided to play solidly. Gradually the position became level, then it
was Botvinnik who obtained a slight advantage. Not anticipating such a turn of
events, Black played the ending uncertainly, and although the game was
adjourned there was no need for a resumption. By my win in the second game I
succeeded in levelling the score for the last time in the match. In the
Caro-Kann Defence Botvinnik introduced a very important innovation, which
neutralised the very system which, during our preparations, we had decided to
make our main weapon against 1...c6. For a long time Black had a good position,
but in the time-scramble I managed to 'outwit' my opponent and, after a
sleepless night with Koblents, I won the game on resumption. Here,
incidentally, for the first time I sealed a move (for the return match the two
envelopes had been abolished). Beginning with the third game, Botvinnik took
the lead. In the fourth and fifth games I managed to extricate myself, the
sixth was a quiet draw (evidently the only one in the whole match), and then
in the seventh came a further telling blow.}) 0-1

Variation had been taken into account. However, White's tenth and eleventh
moves (undoubtedly planned beforehand by Botvinnik) showed that my opponent
had studied not only everything that had already occurred, but also everything
that might occur.} 1-0

Nd7+ {I appeared to be coming into form, and at a 'council of war' the
decision was taken to attempt, in the next few games, to change the course of
the match in complications. Alas, this hope was not destined to be fulfilled.
It began when I caught a bad cold, and was forced to take two consecutive rest
days. There was a great temptation to use the whole limit, but in the end I
decided to save one rest day, just in case. This was perhaps a mistake.
Literally straight from hospital I attempted to play aggressively, and for
this I was essentially unprepared. Botvinnik easily parried Black's attack,
and soon achieved both a positional and a material advantage. Black's one
achievement in this game was to make it last for 73 moves. --- Events
developed similarly in the following game. My fully viable 'reserve' variation
against the Caro-Kann (3 e5 Bf5 4 h4) was thoroughly spoiled by my poor 9th
and 10th moves. Botvinnik quickly obtained the better ending, and all my
tactical tricks proved fruitless. --- In the eleventh game came the opposite
extreme. It is difficult to explain by anything but demoralisation my decision
to play the Slav Defence, for almost the first time in my life, almost
imploring my opponent to exchange on d5, and, with a lead of three points, let
me off with a draw. Botvinnik fulfilled the first part of this programme, but
for some reason he considered his lead to be insufficient, and he adopted a
continuation for White which he had prepared some 15 years before our game.
Black was unable to find the correct rejoinder, and soon after the opening the
game transposed into an ending highly favourable for White. --- Today I
realise that a difference of four points essentially signifies the end of a
match. At that time I did not realise this, and I battled on with, I would say,
considerable optimism, which was reflected to a certain extent in the
statistics of the match. Things were apparently alright with my 'forwards' - I
managed to win five games (six in 1960) - but my defence... the ten defeats
tell the whole story. In some games I would allow Botvinnik to slip out, in
others he would do the same to me, but my opponent approached closer and
closer to the 12½ point mark. On losing in the eighteenth game, after which
the score became 11½-5½, I was already prepared in the following game to
congratulate Botvinnik on his overall victory. It was just at that time that
my old friend, International Master (now Grandmaster) Padevsky arrived in
Moscow from Bulgaria, having already prepared an article on the return match 
(more accurately, the title of the article was: 'The king is dead, long live
the king!'). We went to the nineteenth game together, and outside the Estrada
theatre came across a large number of vehicles: the Newsreel and Central
Television organisations had sent their correspondents along to cover the
anticipated coronation. It was evidently this circumstance that thoroughly
aroused me, and I played the 19th game as though to spite the press (see the
following game).} 1-0

pleasant was the fact that, in this game, our analysis of the adjourned
position proved to be more accurate than that from Botvinnik's celebrated
laboratory. --- Once again some illusory hopes appeared. In his article
'Analysis or improvisation', written soon after the match, Botvinnik said that
he had been very tired, and that if the 20th game had turned out unfavourably
for him, it was not clear how the match would have ended. This is, of course,
an exaggeration, but in any event the 20th proved to be a record game, both in
the number of moves (120!), and in the number of man-days. It was twice
adjourned, and twice resumed. At first the game was adjourned in a position
where I knew there was a win, but we were unable to find the most accurate
plan. On the resumption, after only 4 moves, Botvinnik played a line which we
had not foreseen. The game began to look drawish, but then it was Black who
made a mistake. After 88 moves the game was once again adjourned. The
preceding games, played in a continuously tense atmosphere, had evidently
exhausted both players. At any rate, on returning to the hotel after the first
resumption, I simply did not have the strength to continue analysing. The game
appeared to be won, but during the next two days we were unable to discover
anything new. Perhaps therefore, when I once again took my place on the stage,
I failed to notice the expressive faces of the stage attendants, who had heard
from Botvinnik that his position was hopeless, nor did I pay any attention to
the absence of my opponent's traditional thermos, and even failed to take into
account the distressed shaking of his head. --- By finding a clever idea based
on a stalemating possibility, Botvinnik succeeded in saving the game. This
finally settled matters. --- There has been a great deal written about the
result of the return match. Of course, I do not consider that I played better
in this match than at any time in my life, but I can assure the reader that my
preparations for the second match were no less, and in no way inferior, to
those for the first match. Meanwhile, so many reasons have been found to
explain the fall after my ascent, that I myself would like to try my hand in
this field of journalistic solidarity, as it were.} (75... Kc1 {I have managed
to find two reasons: the reader can judge for himself how serious they are: (1)
During the 1960 match, Botvinnik and I lived in adjacent rooms in the 'Moscow'
hotel. Before games, my second would make his protégé happy by singing
Neapolitan songs. This inspired me, but in all probability demoralised
Botvinnik. During the return match Botvinnik did not stay in the 'Moscow'
hotel. --- (2) By the eighth game of the return match I finally succeeded in
selecting a 'lucky' pencil. Alas, after winning, I left it on the table. When,
a week later, I returned, the pencil had gone (perhaps an unknown supporter of
Mikhail Moiseyevich had taken it). I did not manage to find an adequate
replacement. --- This is all, as they say, 'journalism'. Seriously speaking, I
was quite unprepared for the change which had taken place in Botvinnik. He
arrived for the 1961 match extremely self-disciplined and aggressive, readily
going in for a stormy position if it looked favourable for him, which he had
not done in 1960. In the main one must look to the form of the winner to find
an explanation for the result of the match. --- In conclusion, I should remark
that the defeat did not provoke a crisis in my game, although I have read this
on a number of occasions. Three months later I succeeded in taking first place
in a strong tournament. --- This was the tournament in Bled, but before this I
made my debut as Ex-World Champion in the European Team Championship at
Oberhausen. Of the chess events I should mention the game with Toran given
here, and the last time (for the moment!) that I adopted the French Defence,
against Portisch, which led to the score between us becoming 1-1. --- But now
about Bled, the 'Tournament of the Century', as it was called at the time.
Once again the familiar town, the same hotel, though a different tournament
hall which had only just been built. The majority of the competitors were
Grandmasters. --- I was evidently still very conservative, for my first result
to appear in the table was a nought. After adjourning my first game against
Ivkov, I then went down without a fight against Fischer. About once a year I
used to write down one move, and then make a different one, and on this
occasion, as a result of such a transposition, I had a difficult position as
early as the 6th(!!) move, and by the 10th or 12th a lost one. --- In this
tournament I realised that the two matches with Botvinnik had not been
altogether to no purpose, since along with sharp games I succeeded in winning
several by purely strategic means, 'à la Botvinnik'. The most important of
these was the encounter in the last round with Najdorf. At this point I was
leading Fischer by only half a point.}) 0-1

{JOURNALIST. One question in passing. When everything is going well for you,
and then suddenly the tournament situation becomes critical, how does this
affect you? --- CHESS PLAYER. It becomes more interesting and I even begin to
get nervous, which is also good. During a tournament a player has no right to
be a mummy, but the nervousness must come from inspiration and not from a
shaking of the knees. --- It was especially interesting on this occasion, for
Fischer, who was my rival, demonstratively took Najdorf aside to prepare him
for our game. It was quite clear: Najdorf was being initiated into the secrets
of an interesting variation of the Sicilian Defence, which Fischer
systematically and successfully later adopted as Black. --- On the evening
before the game, the Soviet Grandmasters were with Gligoric in the hotel bar,
when Fischer came up to the table and confidentially informed me: 'You will
lose tomorrow to Najdorf. But on the whole you haven't played badly, and I
have no objection to sharing first place with you, so I won't win against
Ivkov.' --- I did my best to dissuade Robert, but he stuck to his opinion. The
following day I played a completely different variation against Najdorf.

part of the deal: he played nearly 20 moves more against Ivkov, literally
until there were only the kings left, but did not manage to win. --- On the
return journey, Keres and I had to 'jump out' of the plane, which stopped off
at Kiev on the flight from Belgrade to Moscow. There we ran to catch the
Kiev-Riga flight, and the following day were already at the board in the
semifinal of the USSR team tournament. Although there were only three rounds
of the tournament remaining, for me it was still the start! And so, inevitably
giving in to the mysterious force, I straight away lost to the candidate
master Barstatis... --- This was followed by a quick draw with my
flight-companion Keres, and then I managed to celebrate my son's first
birthday with a victory over Averbakh (see the following game).} 1-0

final, which pleased us all. But before this final took place, the fate of the
individual USSR Championship gold medal was to be decided. --- This
Championship went so badly for me, that during it I was even reminded of my
tournament position in the quarter-final at Vilnius. Perhaps this was because,
in my game at the start with Bagirov, a kind of psychological change took
place in my conscious mind. My opponent was in severe time-trouble. I had a
winning position, and I saw a sharp but convincing enough way to win. Just
here the thought entered my head that, in our second match, Botvinnik had many
times ignored my time-trouble, and had played somehow exaggeratedly calmly. So
I set my king off on an unnecessary journey, whereupon my astonished opponent
gave several instant checks, reducing his time deficit with every move. My
king crossed half the board before I realised that in the place he was heading
for he would be mated. There was no way back, and Bagirov forced perpetual
check. --- Although only half a point had been lost, which over a distance of
21 rounds is almost insignificant, the 'favourable wind' had also died down.
As a result, in the subsequent rounds, there followed one draw after another,
including some that were pretty annoying.} 1-0

1. e4 e6 {Was this a surprise? In my opinion, no. At any event, when we were
preparing for the match, my trainer Alexander Koblents and I had considered
the adoption of the French Defence to be a very real possibility. Although in
his second match with Smyslov (1957) this opening did not prove particularly
successful for Botvinnik, the fact that he adhered so exceptionally to his
creative principles gave every reason for thinking that he would not give up
further tests of the French Defence, which had brought him so many glorious
victories. The last 'French' game of theoretical significance was played
between Gligoric and Petrosian in the Candidates Tournament (1959), and
brought success in the opening to White. It stands to reason that we had
studied this game, and were not averse to a repetition of the opening moves.
Since it was also obvious that Botvinnik too had examined this game, in the
opening of our very first encounter there began an unusual psychological duel.
Before my second move I thought for a minute, remembering the numerous
branches of this opening, and trying to guess which one my opponent had
decided to choose.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 {The French Defence is one of the most
complicated openings. For a long time the opening was thought to lead to a
complicated manoeuvring game without any immediate clashes, but by the efforts
of Soviet theorists, in particular Rauzer (for White) and Botvinnik (for Black)
, ways were found of greatly sharpening the position. --- In the variation
adopted by Botvinnik in this game, Black parts with his dark-squared bishop,
which weakens his kingside to a significant degree. As enduring compensation
for this he gains pressure on White's somewhat compromised queenside. Many
games begun with this opening have shown that, if White does not succeed in
quickly taking the initiative, the weaknesses in his position will tell sooner
or later. For this reason White players now aim to force events, in order to
hinder the consolidation of the opponent's forces.} 4. e5 c5 5. a3 Bxc3+ {

position from the opening. --- It was evidently because of 7 Qg4 that
Botvinnik gave up 5..Ba5, although even here the last word has certainly not
been said. From this point of view, the game Matanovic-Mititelu (Zonal
Tournament, Budapest 1960) is of great interest. It should be mentioned,
incidentally, that in recent times the move Qg4 has become something of a
'visiting card' for White in the French Defence, in cases where he is striving
for the maximum from the opening.})) 6. bxc3 Qc7 {This move also has an
interesting history.} (6... Ne7 {looks more flexible, since the king's knight
has to be developed on this square, whereas in some cases the black queen can

my memory does not betray me, the last time Botvinnik played 6...Ne7 was in

to develop the queen at the start of the game.}) 8. Qg3 Ne7 {With this last
move Black emphasises that he is not at all afraid of the capture on g7.} ({To
avoid this he could have first exchanged in the centre:} 8... cxd4 9. cxd4 {,

succeeded in repelling the attack with accurate defence and even in winning
the game, but even so there are few players to whom the resulting position
appeals, since White acquires an appreciable positional plus: his dark-squared
bishop, which for the moment is operating only on one diagonal, can make its
way via d2 to b4, where it will be much more actively placed. --- 'The last of
the Mohicans' trying to uphold this variation with Black is now a gifted young
player from East Germany - Reinhardt Fuchs. He has twice employed this
continuation against Soviet players - with Spassky in the Student World
Championship in Varna (1958) and with Vasiukov (Gotha 1957), but both times he
was crushed in about 25 moves.}) 9. Qxg7 ({In the 14th game of his match with
Botvinnik (1957), Smyslov avoided the complications by playing} 9. Bd2 {. In
this case Black developed his forces as in the above-mentioned game with
Reshevsky, and gained a good position thanks to the passive placing of White's
queen's bishop. I am convinced that, if White wants to gain an opening
advantage, he should on no account reject this type of double-edged
continuation, which is always the most critical and usually the strongest.})

have been horrified by such a move. At the very start of the game the white
king voluntarily embarks on a journey. Now, however, few are surprised by this
eccentric continuation. For the moment White prefers to camouflage his plans
for the development of his king's knight, retaining the option of it going
either to e2 or to f3, and he also leaves clear the f1-a6 diagonal. For the
moment the loss of the right to castle is not important since, firstly, the
opponent's pieces are insufficiently developed, and secondly, at e8 the black
king too is not very comfortable. --- As far as I recall, the only game in
which} 11. Kd1 {(recommended by Euwe, incidentally) has been tested was the
above-mentioned Gligoric-Petrosian game. The Soviet grandmaster continued with
the straightforward} Nbc6 12. Nf3 Nxe5 {, and after the very strong move} 13.

Botvinnik's keen analytical searching.}) 11... Bd7 {A very cunning move, by
which Black hopes to exploit the offensive power of the queen at c7, in order
to emphasise the vulnerable position of the white king. The pieces have to be
developed in any case, but first it is best to bring out the bishop.} ({If,
after} 11... Bd7 {, White plays} 12. Nf3 {, then after} Ba4 13. Bd3 Qxc3 {his
position immediately becomes critical.}) ({In the event of} 11... Bd7 12. Ne2 {
Black can again continue} Ba4 {, with the unpleasant threat of 13...d3. It is
apparent, therefore, that the move 11...Bd7 simultaneously pursues two aims: a
strategic one - the completion of development and queenside castling, and a
tactical one - a blow against c2. If White does not want to come under a
strong attack, he must play very actively. There is a basis for this. With 7...f5 Black has rid himself of his f7-pawn, the guarding of which is an
unpleasant role often undertaken by the king itself, but on the other hand he
has weakened the h5-e8 diagonal, which exposes the king and deprives any black
pieces that end up on this diagonal of 'material' support. In addition, the
white queen can now return home with gain of tempo.}) 12. Qh5+ Ng6 ({If} 12...

{Although it had given me a one-point advantage, the start of the match had
not completely satisfied me. In the last four games my opponent had been able
to direct the play along his favourite channels and had invariably held the
initiative. To expect that I would be able to continue gaining draws after
prolonged defence would have been highly frivolous. Therefore we decided at
all costs to change the character of the play. Once again the already tiresome
question was on the agenda: which opening to play? Both the Nimzo-Indian
Defence and the Modern Benoni had in general not produced the desired effect.
There remained one more double-edged opening - the classical King's Indian
Defence, and it was this that we chose. A definite role in this was played by
the fact that against the King's Indian Botvinnik usually chooses a rather
old-fashioned continuation with the fianchetto of the king's bishop, which, in
my opinion, does not give White any opening advantage, and avoids the
fashionable lines (the Samisch and Petrosian Variations) which are considered
White's most dangerous weapons. The very first moves confirmed the correctness
of our assumption.} 1. c4 {This, along with 1 d4, is Botvinnik's favourite
move. The aim of it, in particular, is to avoid undesirable opening lines,
such as the Nimzo-Indian Defence, for example.} ({Thus after} 1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3
e6 {White can, say, continue} 3. Nf3 {, delaying d2-d4.}) ({In the event of} 1.
c4 e5 {a Sicilian Defence arises with colours reversed, where the extra tempo
naturally plays an important role.}) ({By maintaining the symmetry with} 1. c4
c5 {Black can take play into the English Opening, but it is well known that
Botvinnik plays it in masterly style with both White and Black. After a little
thought, Black decided to make a move that leaves the question open.}) 1... Nf6
2. Nf3 {To some extent White declares his intentions. He emphasises that he
does not intend to play the Nimzo-Indian Defence, nor in the King's Indian
Defence to play the sharp Samisch Variation, in which, as is known, a basic
element of White's play is the propping-up of his centre by f2-f3.} ({At the
same time Botvinnik avoids a variation that was popular in the recent past - a
branch of the English Opening which was still possible after} 2. Nc3 g6 3. g3
Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. e4 d6 6. Nge2 {. White follows up with d2-d3 and then,
depending on which black pawn takes part in the battle for the centre - ...c5
or ...e5 - he begins attacking it either in the first case by a2-a3 and b2-b4,
or in the second case by f2-f4. However, experience has shown that Black's
control of d4 gives him a quite comfortable position, and in particular
Smyslov scored a very logical win in the first game of his match with
Botvinnik in 1957. Botvinnik tried this variation again with White against
Gurgenidze in the 2nd USSR Spartakiad (1959), but in this case too Black
gained satisfactory play from the opening. Now, however, this variation is
not possible, since White has developed his king's knight at f3.}) 2... g6 {
The King's Indian Defence has an interesting history. It received wide
recognition some twenty years ago. Before that the opening was only employed
from time to time and, so to speak, spontaneously. In particular, such a
set-up was chosen long ago by Chigorin, but White's superiority in the centre,
the apparent passivity of the bishop at g7, running up against its own pawn at
e5, and Black's cramped position did not inspire much confidence. In the late
1930s a group of Ukrainian players led by Konstantinopolsky, Boleslavsky and
Bronstein set about making a detailed study of this rejected opening, and gave
it a second wind. Which chess enthusiast is not familiar with David
Bronstein's virtuoso combinations in his games against Pachman and Zita 
(Moscow v. Prague match, 1946), in which the 'inactive' bishop at g7 carried
out its destructive work? For this, it is true, Black sacrificed 'only' a rook.
Which chess enthusiast has not been enraptured by the brilliant ideas of the
King's Indian devotees' 'younger brother', the Odessa grandmaster Yefim Geller,
in whose hands this opening has become a formidable weapon? --- New systems of
development for Black appeared, and the move ...e7-e5 ceased to be obligatory;
in many games Black attacked the centre with ...c7-c5, or sometimes altogether
avoided moving his c- and e-pawns, preferring piece pressure on the centre
with ...Nc6 and ..Bg4. The idea of immediate counterplay on the queenside with
...a7-a6 and ...b7-b5 also appeared. As a rule, Black was able to carry out
all these ideas most successfully with the white king's bishop at g2, and so
players of the King's Indian for White also began employing other set-ups.
They revived the Sämisch Variation, which usually leads to a very sharp battle
with castling on opposite sides, where White tries to demonstrate that the
move ...g7-g6 significantly weakens Black's kingside. Initially this variation
brought White some success, but by the efforts of faithful King's Indian
players (in particular Geller and Gligoric) sufficiently effective antidotes
were found. Grandmaster Tigran Petrosian in turn suggested a very dangerous
idea, involving the development of the bishop at g5 (from where it hinders
Black's counterplay on the kingside), followed by the advance of the white
pawns on the opposite wing, with the aim of opening lines. For the moment the
last word for Black in this variation belongs to the talented Ukrainian master
Leonid Stein, who played ...h7-h6 before Bg5 and thereby nipped White's idea
in the bud, true, at the cost of a tempo. All the same, recent events have
shown that the fashion for the King's Indian Defence has begun to pass, and
even such devotees as Petrosian, Bronstein and Geller have frequently chosen
other set-ups. Perhaps this has happened because its novelty has faded,
perhaps because White's play has become more purposeful, but in any case it is
far too early to write off the King's Indian Defence, since, even if does give
White a slight advantage, Black achieves just as viable a position as in any
other opening.} 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. d4 {White gradually determines his
pawn configuration.} ({Here or a couple of moves later he still had the
possibility of playing} 5. d3 {, giving the game a closed character. It must
be assumed that Botvinnik did not want to define the play so sharply, since in
this variation White gains the initiative on the queenside, but Black gains a
counterattack on the kingside. My opponent probably did not want to allow such
a possibility right from the opening, especially since several recent games,
the most memorable of them being Pirc-Boleslavsky (USSR v. Yugoslavia,
Leningrad 1957), have confirmed its effectiveness.}) ({After} 5. d4 {Black has
to decide which variation to choose. He can switch to the Grünfeld Defence with
} d5 {, but I have only played it very rarely and feel insufficiently at home
in these positions.} ({The attempt to switch to a symmetrical set-up with} 5...
c6 {followed by ...d7-d5 leads to a dull game with a slight advantage for
White.})) 5... d6 6. Nc3 Nbd7 {Another committal move. Black demonstrates his
intention to play the King's Indian in its 'original' form. This was the
variation used when it began being played in important tournaments.} ({In many
games I have preferred the set-ups with} 6... c5) ({and} 6... Nc6 {. The
continuation chosen here has occurred much more rarely in my games, and we
assumed that Botvinnik would be correspondingly less prepared for it.}) 7. O-O
e5 8. e4 c6 {The most flexible. Black does not object to the closing of the
centre, since in this case his knight obtains a comfortable post at c5 and, in
addition, with the centre closed his hands are freed for play on the kingside
- his knight moves from f6 to e8 or h5, making way for the f-pawn. The
immediate capture on d4 promises a definite advantage for White, who gains
more freedom in the centre and on the kingside.} 9. h3 ({In many games
Botvinnik tried to demonstrate that this move, defending the bishop at e3
against attack, is a waste of time, and he preferred the immediate} 9. Be3 {,
but in the 14th game of the Botvinnik-Smyslov match (1954) Black found a
convincing reply to this move-order. He played} Ng4 10. Bg5 Qb6 $1 11. h3 exd4
$1 12. Na4 Qa6 13. hxg4 b5 14. Nxd4 bxa4 15. Nxc6 Qxc6 16. e5 Qxc4 17. Bxa8
Nxe5 {and in a sharp battle Smyslov gained the advantage.}) ({The prophylactic
move} 9. h3 {is after all necessary. White's plans include the harmonious
development of his pieces in the region of the centre, and if sooner or later
he should succeed in forcing the opponent to exchange on d4, he will gain the
opportunity to exert pressure on the weak d6-pawn.} {Black has usually based
his counterplay on the long-range bishop at g7, but with careful play White is
able to neutralise it. Such a course has occurred many times in games where
Black has exchanged immediately on d4,} exd4 ({or continued} 9... a5 {and ...Re8. Black's difficulties in this variation prompted him to begin searching
for more active continuations, one of which (incidentally, also of Ukrainian
origin) is the text-move.}) ({During recent years} 9... Qa5 {, with similar
ideas, has also become popular, but since I had already employed this move in
tournament games, I did not want to repeat it in the match.})) 9... Qb6 {Black
immediately begins action against d4.} ({After} 9... Qb6 {he is threatening a
familiar combination, namely} 10. -- exd4 11. Nxd4 Nxe4 $1 {.}) ({And after} 
9... Qb6 {, at the same time he sets his 'sights' on the c4-pawn (} 10. -- Qb4
{).}) ({Thus if White wants to maintain the tension in the centre, he has to
reckon with numerous counter-ideas by Black. It should not be forgotten that
in some cases (after an eventual ...Ng4) the queen at b6 can create threats to
the f2-pawn. Our choice of opening proved psychologically successful.
Botvinnik again avoids double-edged tactical continuations, and prefers the
immediate closing of the centre, hoping to gain time by attacking the queen.
The other way of relieving the tension in the centre after} 9... Qb6 {,} 10.
dxe5 {, gives White little - Black obtains a comfortable outpost at d4, and
the queen can return to its usual position at e7 via b4.}) 10. d5 cxd5 11. cxd5
Nc5 {The first virtue of the plan selected by Black is evident: his knight has
occupied an active position and is already attacking a pawn.} 12. Ne1 {During
the game I assumed that this was a theoretical innovation.} ({More common here
is} 12. Re1) ({or} 12. Nd2 {, in order to transfer the knight to c4 with gain
of tempo. In this case, however, Black retains freedom of action and can
initiate play both on the queenside by preparing ...b7-b5 and ...Ba6, and on
the kingside by advancing ...f7-f5.}) ({Later, however, I learned that} 12. Ne1
{had been played by Petrosian in a game with Shiyanovsky in a USSR
Championship Semi-final (Kiev 1957) which he won quickly (true, the virtues of
the move 12 Ne1 were nothing to do with this). --- White does not intend to
tolerate for long the 'annoying' knight at c5 and prepares to exchange it. The
role of the piece that will gain a tempo is assigned to the bishop at c1.
Nevertheless, 12 Ne1 has the drawback that White loses a certain amount of
time and the opponent is able to complete his development unhindered. This is
precisely what Shiyanovsky forgot to do in the above-mentioned game, deciding
instead to try and conclude matters immediately with an attack on the kingside.
}) 12... Bd7 13. Nd3 {Botvinnik is of the opinion that frequent appearances in
tournaments are not so essential. Of course, the methods of working during a
preparation period are a matter of taste for every player. At the same time,
modern chess has now reached such a high level that knowledge and ability
alone are insufficient. Every game demands an enormous output of nervous
energy, and therefore regular (more or less frequent) participation in
competitions is necessary for a player to keep in form. The text-move, or,
more precisely, the time spent on it, demonstrate that Botvinnik had not
played competitive chess for a long time. On the quite obvious and undoubtedly
strongest continuation of the manoeuvre begun with the previous move, did he
really have to spend ten minutes out of his overall budget of two and a half
hours? How many times has a player lacked precisely these ten minutes at a
decisive moment!} Nxd3 14. Qxd3 Rfc8 {The critical position. Here Black spent
a long time deciding which plan to adopt in the middle game. He wanted to play
...f7-f5, which gains in strength with the pawns at h3 and g3, since White's
kingside is to some extent weakened.} ({However, the straight forward} 14...
Nh5 {does not achieve its aim in view of} 15. Be3 Qd8 16. Qe2 $1 {, and now
after} f5 17. exf5 {Black has to reconcile himself to a positionally difficult
game after} Bxf5 {.}) ({I did not want to prepare ...f7-f5 by 14...Ne8, as I
was afraid that the queenside would be inadequately defended. Nevertheless, a
more detailed analysis shows that this continuation deserved serious
consideration. After} 14... Ne8 15. Be3 Qd8 {for the moment White cannot
create any real threats on the queenside, and ...f7-f5 can be played without
hindrance. Whether this continuation gives anything real after, for example,}
16. Rac1 f5 17. exf5 gxf5 18. f4 {- that is another question. All the same,
the bishop at g7 comes actively into the game. Black (also partly on
psychological grounds) decided for the moment to play on the queenside, and
then, having dulled the opponent's vigilance, to advance ...f7-f5 at a
convenient moment. I have to admit that at this point I was already seized
with the idea of the knight sacrifice at f4, which, however, was still very
hazy. Black moved to c8 with his king's rook, firstly, to keep his a7-pawn
defended, and secondly, to show White that he was not even thinking about the
kingside.}) 15. Rb1 {A highly revealing manoeuvre. White takes the opponent at
his word, and also concentrates on queenside play.} ({He intends Be3, but with
this aim the immediate} 15. Qe2 {was also possible, which at the same time
would have prevented ...Nh5 followed by ...f7-f5. The position of the rook at
b1 will later give Black a very important tempo.}) 15... Nh5 {Now the opponent
can also be disturbed on the other wing. It transpires that, for the advance
of the f-pawn, the support of the rook is not after all so necessary.} 16. Be3

since in this case the switching of the king's rook to c8 would have lost its
point. White could have played} 17. Nb5 {, forcing a favourable exchange. For
the moment Black adheres to the plan already mentioned - obvious play on the
queenside and latent play on the kingside.}) 17. Qe2 {The threat of ...f7-f5
has become unpleasant, because the white f-pawn is tied to the defence of the
g3-pawn, and in addition, after the opening of the diagonal for his bishop,
Black's pieces on the queenside would be very appropriately placed. It becomes
evident that 15 Rb1 was inaccurate - White has lost an important tempo.} Rc4 ({
The line} 17... f5 18. exf5 Bxf5 19. Rbc1 {, conceding the e4-square, would
have been positionally unjustified. Black decides to advance ...f7-f5 when it
is more effective, and now the knight sacrifice at f4 becomes more and more of
a reality. It was with the aim of preparing the sacrifice that Black chose his
following move, which seems completely natural - the doubling of rooks on the
c-file followed by play on the queenside.}) 18. Rfc1 {Completely trusting the
opponent. White wants to begin 'smoking out' the black pieces by Bf1 and then
to find a convenient moment to carry out mass exchanges. An ending will be
very favourable for him, in view of the fact that Black's knight at h5 and
bishop at g7 are stuck on the kingside and cannot easily be switched to the
defence.} Rac8 {Sixteen minutes were spent considering this obvious move -
Black was weighing up whether or not the idea, carried out a little later,
would work now. No, it does not work. The variation has to be strengthened.}
19. Kh2 {A move which would have been very useful (he moves his king off the
back rank, defending in case of necessity the g3-pawn), were it not for the
real danger suddenly impending over White's position. Botvinnik evidently
assumed that there were absolutely no threats and decided to make a useful
prophylactic move, intending to follow up with either Bf3 or Bf1.} ({It is
true that even after the immediate} 19. Bf3 {(or Bf1) there would have followed
} f5 {.}) 19... f5 $1 {After this waiting move Black reckons that everything
is ready for the combination, and he makes the introductory 'anti-positional'
move.} 20. exf5 Bxf5 21. Ra1 ({In the event of} 21. a3 Qb3 22. Ne4 Rc2 23. Rxc2

} 21. Ra1 {, in view of the threat of 22 g4, the black pieces were now forced
to retreat and that White would be able to occupy the e4-square in comfort,
but here the prepared surprise awaited him.}) 21... Nf4 {The controversy
provoked by this move was, in my opinion, rather pointless. It is good, in
that all other continuations are bad, and if the knight sacrifice is incorrect,
then a question mark should be attached not to Black's 21st move, but, say, to
his 17th. All the same, after the knight sacrifice Black's pieces (this
applies especially to the recently 'unemployed' bishop at g7) become very
active over the entire board and White is obliged to switch to the concrete
analysis of numerous sharp variations. The acceptance of the sacrifice is
forced.} 22. gxf4 exf4 23. Bd2 ({'} 23. a3 {would have won the game'. This was
the essence of an article by Goldberg with an analysis of this position,

numerous interesting variations confirming this viewpoint. The critical
position arises after} Qb3 24. Bxa7 {.}) ({The immediate} 23. Bxa7 {is refuted
by} Qa5 {, when Black regains the piece, retaining all the advantages of his
position.}) ({It is hardly worth trying to convince the reader that Black had
evaluated in detail all the variations and had decided that the knight
sacrifice at f4 would win. Rather, 21...Nf4 was a purely positional sacrifice.
Let us in fact look at the position that arises in the variation recommended
by Goldberg after} 23. a3 Qb3 24. Bxa7 {. --- For the moment White's extra
piece does not play a part, especially as Black can shut it out of the game by
...b7-b6, whereas both black bishops are extremely active, and can operate
both on the queenside and on the kingside. White's queenside is also rather
rigid, and his king's protection is weakened. Thus Black's positional
compensation is evident, and the question to be answered by a detailed
analysis is whether he can transform it into something more tangible. I was
intending to continue} Be5 {, threatening 25...f3+. White has three ways of
defending: he can retreat his king to g1, or he can prevent the opening of the
diagonal by 25 f3 or 25 Bf3. Let us consider these continuations in turn.} 25.

, and after} 25. Kg1 b6 {,} 26. Qd1 Qxb2 27. Ra2 Rxc3 $1 {does not help. It
follows that White cannot release his bishop, and if so, then the position is
materially equal but in practice favourable for Black.}) ({. Things are much
more difficult for Black if White does not retreat his king to the back rank.} 
25. f3 {. On the one hand, with this move White intends to return the
'runaway' from a7, but on the other hand he completely blocks in the other
bishop at g2. Black replies with the routine} b6 {,} 26. -- ({when} 26. Qf2 {
is ineffective, as Black continues} Bd4 {and then ...Be3 with gain of tempo.})

nothing better than to force a draw, either by going for perpetual check, or
by continuing} 32. Qxf4 Ree2 33. Qg3 {. These variations do not cause any
arguments.})) ({. The most interesting play results from 25 Bf3. The analysis
of this continuation was the reason given by Goldberg for claiming Black's
combination to be completely incorrect. The fact that the position is by no
means as simple as Goldberg writes, is convincingly demonstrated by
Konstantinopolsky in his analysis on the pages of the 'Moscow Chess Bulletin'.
During the game I was also intending to sacrifice my queen in this variation,
but I avoided calculating further, reckoning that Black gains real
compensation. Konstantinopolsky found a very interesting tactical confirmation
of this. After the moves} 25. Bf3 b6 26. Qd1 Qxb2 27. Ra2 Rxc3 {(It is
noteworthy that Black's continuations are invariably the same. This, in my
opinion, provides indirect evidence of the correctness of the combination.

very recently were 'occupied' with the queenside, suddenly switch to a direct
attack on the king. For example:} 30. Kg2 Bxf3+ 31. Kxf3 R8c3+ 32. Ke4 Rc4+ 33.

moment the material deficit is not felt. It is possible that ways of improving
White's defence will subsequently be found, but the present commentary by no
means claims to be a detailed analysis of all the variations that could have
occurred. Its role is to reveal the course of the struggle through the eyes of
one of the participants, and from this point of view I am convinced that the
double-edged knight sacrifice at f4 was the correct decision.}))) 23... Qxb2 {
. It is interesting that on the move after the knight sacrifice Black thought
for 15 minutes. Was this the result of an oversight? Or a desire to check the
variations? Neither one, nor the other. It was merely a confirmation, so to
speak, of the intuitive nature of the sacrifice, a confirmation that Black had
not calculated variations beginning with the sacrifice and ending in mate.
Also no less indicative was the fact that later analysis showed this move to
be incorrect.} ({While I was thinking, I had already written down on my
scoresheet} 23... Be5 {, a move which, as it transpires, was the strongest.

White has to make do with a draw, is in itself a considerable achievement for
Black. When I played the text-move, I reckoned that the game should end in a

by Black could have rebounded on him, but all this occurred because of his
mistake on the 23rd move. As I have already pointed out, Botvinnik considered
the capture on f3 to be favourable to Black, and he preferred the immediate
exchange of queens. Psychologically this is quite understandable: when you are

very severe warning to the spectators, since during the subsequent games they
did not give cause for such a measure, but the feeling, when the clocks are
stopped and you are politely asked to leave the stage, moreover at the very
height of the game, can also hardly be called pleasant. At any rate, I am

1. e4 e6 $1 {What is this, immodesty? Even the most subjective of chess
players has never given an exclamation mark to this move, which has been known
for a long time. But should this move deserve approval (for reasons not
appertaining to chess), then the immodesty of the annotator is not so great.
He really only deserves half an exclamation mark, the other half being due to
A. Koblents, since it was during the process of preparing for this game that
the idea of playing the French Defence occurred to us, although I have adopted
this opening very, very rarely, and without great success. Even so, the choice
of such a variation must have been an unpleasant surprise for Fischer, since
positions of this type have occurred in his games very rarely, and a study of
his games showed that the American Champion feels much less confident in
unfamiliar positions. To be honest I should admit that, after deciding prior
to the game to play the French Defence, at the board it took me about 10
minutes to decide on the advance of my e-pawn.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5.

1960 chess bulletins a note by international master Konstantinopolsky appeared,

remember how, before the match with Botvinnik, Koblents and I spent some
considerable time playing through these variations, though at the time we were
unable to test them, since in the 1960 match Botvinnik did not adopt this
system. --- A short time later chess magazines all over the world, including

{Every year traditional Christmas tournaments are held in a number of towns.
The best known competition of this type is the tournament in the small English
town of Hastings, which was first held as early as 1895. Recently they have
begun to hold such tournaments in Holland (Beverwijk), and also in Sweden. ---
It was to the New Year tournament in Stockholm that Soviet grandmasters Kotov
and I were invited. It should be added that the 1960-1961 Tournament was timed
to coincide with an important jubilee of the Swedish Chess Organisation. Early
in 1911 the Stockholm Chess Club was formed, and for half a century now it has
been the centre for Swedish chess players. Therefore, the Jubilee Tournament
was, if one can so express it, especially festive. --- We arrived in the
Swedish capital on 28th December at 10 o'clock local time. It turned out that
we had been expected since the previous evening, but even so we had flown in
just at the right time - we still had at our disposal a whole half hour before
the start of a televised game. Of course, the time set aside for us to rest
flew past unnoticed, and when we assembled in the television studio, we felt
somewhat exhausted. --- My opponent was the well known Swedish Grandmaster
Ståhlberg. The time control was not altogether normal - 50 minutes for the
whole game, so that the viewers should be able to follow the game in its
entirety. Thinking, however, that to follow the game for two hours at a
stretch would also not be easy, the Swedish television authorities decided to
extend the pleasure over three days. This was perhaps more interesting for the
spectators, and also less tiring for the participants, since every 35-40
minutes there was an interval. Grandmaster Kotov took the role of commentator.
Now I can perhaps disclose a small secret. The game was shown from 6th to 8th
January, and the participants had to give their word that until the end of the
transmission no word of the game was to appear in the press. Therefore I only
had the chance to 'boast' about my win following the conclusion of the
tournament.} 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Qb6 6. Bd3 ({In

{Immediately after the Individual Championship, the Team Championship Final
began in Moscow. --- Before this I spent a further day in bed in Baku - once
again I was suffering from kidney colic - and then, in Moscow, almost straight
from the plane, I sat down to play against Smyslov. It is true that the
reserve for our team did everything he could to persuade me to rest,
promising to play successfully, but I nevertheless decided not to dishearten
my team at the very start of the final, and I played against Smyslov until I
felt that I was unable to continue. As a result I drew four games, including,
it is true, two fighting ones, against Korchnoi and Petrosian, and lost one. I
lost because my opponent Stein, readily and with astonishment, made exactly
the winning moves that I had recommended in my notes to some game, and about
which I had completely forgotten during play. --- Even so, it hardly occurred
to me that the third act of this kidney tragi-comedy might occur at, of all
possible times, the Candidates Tournament in Curaçao.} 1. -- {After the
tournament in Moscow, I was not feeling too well, and it was decided to send
me to Marianske Lazne, the world-famous resort. Just before my departure a
deterioration set in, and within 24 hours I had been taken to hospital, put on
the table, and operated upon. The operation was performed by an excellent
surgeon, a veritable grandmaster of world medicine, Professor Frumkin. This
was, unfortunately, to be one of the last operations of his life. When we were
talking before the operation I asked him to bear in mind the fact that within
two months I had to travel to Curaçao, and that it would be good if he could
repeat the 'miracle' of 1959, when after the removal of my appendix I won the
Candidates Tournament. --- The professor listened to my request, and operated
most carefully, but, alas, history did not repeat itself. --- On coming out of
hospital, I began my preparations, and I played two training games against
Gipslis with a shortened time limit - 40 moves in 1½ hours. I played quite
well, and decided that everything was alright. Subsequently, in Curaçao, it
became clear that I was only capable of playing for those same first three
hours in a competitive game. I only found out about this later, and in the
plane, crossing the Atlantic for the first time, I was firmly resolved to
obtain once again an audition with Botvinnik.} (1. -- {JOURNALIST. Did you
know how the other contestants rated your prospects? --- CHESS PLAYER. How
could I? I read the papers, where your colleagues, from force of habit, rated
my chances quite highly, and I agreed with them! Although photographs taken
before the flight show that prior to the tournament I looked somewhat
emaciated. --- The first round in no way warned me, although I adjourned my
game against Petrosian in a lost position. The usual first round result, I
decided. Then the second game, against Keres, made me suspicious. At first
everything went well; I sacrificed my queen and obtained an advantage
sufficient to win, but then came the fifth hour of play, that same hour that
had always brought me so many dividends in the past. Here, however, I began
playing quite terribly. Then in the third round against Benko, in a
time-scramble, in which I had so many times swindled the American Grandmaster,
I myself was swindled. Nought out of three! It was clear: never in my life had
I been in such poor form. For four hours, even four hours and a quarter,
everything was normal, but then a reaction took place, I lost my orientation,
and gave away points with exceptional generosity.}) *

{I gained my first half point in the fourth round against Fischer, which, I
must admit, fairly surprised me. Even then the Achilles' Heel of the future
World Champion - a dislike of sharp, irrational positions - was known. By
embroiling him in this sort of play, I adjourned the game with an advantage,
but Black's sealed move came like a thunderclap.} 41... Rxd5 $3 42. exd5 Bh6 {
, and Black, by placing his bishop on f4, supporting it with his g-pawn, and
giving up his e-pawn by ...e4!, obtained an impregnable position.} (42... -- {
Things continued in the same way. I finished the first cycle with 2 points out
of 7, alone in last place. However, my natural optimism urged me on, and, with
21 games still to go - a whole tournament! - somewhere in my mind I 'changed
my schedule'. Seeing that the competitors at Curaçao were playing more
reservedly than in Yugoslavia three years previously, and that the number of
points required for first place - I didn't even consider any other! - would be
less, I decided to steal up on them. --- Then the second round began with me
playing what was probably the worst game of my life. As White against
Petrosian in a French Defence, somewhere around move 8 I thought for more than
an hour, trying to choose between one of two normal continuations, both of
which would give White an opening advantage. --- First I wrote down one move,
then the other (incidentally, two rounds later, I adopted the second against
Benko, and won, while Spassky played the first against Petrosian a year later,
and also won), and, being unable to decide which was the stronger, I suddenly
made a third, ridiculous move. By move 13 White already stood worse, and then
in addition I immediately blundered away a bishop.}) (42... -- {In this cycle
I suffered a further three successive defeats, when I declined a draw offered
by Fischer, and ruined excellent attacking positions against Filip and Geller,
losing to each of them for the first time. Even my first ever win against
Korchnoi did not especially cheer me. With one half of the tournament gone, I
had moved up one place - to last but one! - with 4½ points. However, the
leaders had 'only' 9! I spent the two-week break still hoping to rest and
regain my form, and with the belief that I would win almost every game in the
3rd and 4th cycles. --- I began with the firm desire to effect an immediate
change. Indeed, against Petrosian, I succeeded in seizing the initiative as
Black, and, frightening my opponent with a combinative threat, won a pawn. ---
I was later told of the dialogue which took place at this point between the
Soviet trainer Boleslavsky and Petrosian's anxious wife. Replying to Rona
Yakovlevna, the imperturbable Boleslavsky remarked that Petrosian stood badly
at the moment, but that what Tal would do in the fifth hour of play was
anybody's guess. I didn't 'do' a great deal - I lost the greater part of my
advantage, and in the adjourned position Petrosian had every chance of a draw.
--- Even so, this game seemed a good omen to me, but the next one - with Keres
- was the last one that I played with any hope of success in the tournament.
By success, I repeat, I mean only first place. --- I thought up a very
interesting combination, and after making a preparatory move, I even went up
to Petrosian and joked: 'I'm going for the brilliancy prize'. The point was
that, in my preliminary calculations, I was planning to sacrifice my queen for
only two minor pieces, but after writing down Qh5, which would have led to the
sacrifice, I instead changed my mind and played Qf3, forgetting about Black's
obvious reply. Within two moves, not a trace of my attack remained, but I was
a pawn down, and soon had to resign. --- It was only then that it became clear
to me that it was time to give up the tournament as lost. After this I played
much more calmly, even imperturbably, and scored four draws - an achievement!
- plus a loss to Geller. In this game I had the advantage, but all the time I
was disturbed by the question: was it right for me, when in my heart I had
given up the fight for first place, to play for a win which would upset the
positions of the leaders: Petrosian, Keres and Geller. At the same time it was
awkward to offer a draw: after all, Geller could hope for me to blunder in the
fifth hour. So, tormented by doubts, I forgot about my clock until I noticed
that I had only a few minutes remaining, whereupon I began playing at blitz
speed. When the time-scramble was over, it turned out that on the way I could
have won White's queen in one move, but in the adjourned position it was
Geller who had the advantage.}) (42... -- {I was intending to play the fourth
cycle without any ambition at all, and perhaps it was because of this that I
had a recurring attack of my illness. Then another, and another. In short, I
went into a local hospital, and there, by the united efforts of the doctors,
the other players, the controllers and the leader of our delegation, I was
persuaded to stop playing. Although I had never withdrawn from an event
through illness since the time of the 4th category tournament and scarlet
fever, I did this with a relatively quiet mind: all seven of my opponents
would be equally affected by my withdrawal. --- After the return home, and a
break of several months, came the Olympiad in Varna. I was included in the
USSR team only, of course, after lengthy debates, and the medical inspection
was 'not inferior' in severity to that which cosmonauts have to undergo. I
managed to overcome this obstacle, and was given the place of second reserve.
--- In my first games I played like a man making his first steps after a long
illness, but as early as the third game (with Mohrlok) I succeeded with an
attractive attack, in which, unfortunately, the main variation remained behind
the scenes. --- In this event I played quite well. True, I did not perform as
a recent World Champion should (on the fourth board the opponents were not as
strong or experienced as those on board one), but well enough to take first
place on my board. --- The following game was unofficially judged to be the
most brilliant played in the Olympiad (see the following game).}) *

-- {Nevertheless, for me the most memorable event of the Olympiad was the
resumption of the Botvinnik-Fischer game. The question of which team would
take first place was already decided, but for this game chess fans gathered
from literally all over Bulgaria. Everyone remembered the recent interview
given by Fischer, in which he had said that he could beat Botvinnik in a match,
and the game therefore held exceptional prestige interest. --- My game,
against D. Byrne, was also adjourned, in an ending slightly favourable for me,
but no-one, myself included, looked at it seriously. Three of us, Boleslavsky,
Spassky and I, set up Botvinnik's position in our room, and got down to
analysing it. We were not the only ones. When, on the advice of our trainer
Boleslavsky, I went off to the family room of Donald and Robert Byrne to offer
a draw, I saw on their table the adjourned position of the Botvinnik-Fischer
game. --- The analysis went on for almost the whole of the night. The three of
us worked together, as did Botvinnik, Geller, Keres and Furman on the floor
above. From time to time the younger players, Spassky and I, would take turns
to go upstairs and exchange conclusions. --- Towards five o' clock in the
morning, Geller's fantastic idea - to battle with two isolated pawns against
two united pawns in a rook ending - had been fully worked out, and we decided
that there were considerable drawing chances. And when, for the last time, we
set off downstairs to sleep Mikhail Moiseyevich said to us: 'Please, if anyone
asks, tell them my position is hopeless!'. We overslept, and missed breakfast
by a long time, but when we arrived in the restaurant we found the Americans
there. They looked sleepy, but contented: they were in no doubt that Fischer's
position was won. --- When we all arrived at the overcrowded tournament hall,
we found the following picture: Botvinnik walking calmly up and down the stage,
Fischer sitting with his head in his hands, and a theoretically drawn position
already on the board.}) (49. -- {The Varna Olympiad helped considerably in
re-establishing my self-confidence. --- Otherwise it is difficult to explain
my result in the USSR Team Championship, which began immediately afterwards in
Leningrad. As always, the opposition on board one was pretty strong, and as
usual my games were aggressive, but even so, in the first 7 rounds I scored 7
(!!) draws. Then, in the last round, an amusing situation arose. The point was
that on the top board, along with Spassky, Keres, Geller, Smyslov and
Boleslavsky, there was a candidate master from Moldavia, Shofman. He had seven
noughts, I had seven draws, and we had to play each other in the last round.
Everyone tried to guess whose tradition would be broken: mine, his, or both
together if he should win. I managed to 'change my principle', and Shofman's
series continued. --- Despite my suddenly acquired reputation as a 'drawing
king', I travelled to the Individual Championship of the USSR in Yerevan in a
good frame of mind, since I felt that with each succeeding month I was
approaching my previous form. --- In Yerevan I started well, and one of my
games, the one with Bannik, is given here. I was flattered by the assessment
given to this game by Petrosian: 'Even if I don't say who made the combination,
it is clear all the same: from far off it smells of Tal!' I was going well: 4
out of 5, 5 out of 6. Then, in quick succession, came defeats at the hands of
the experienced masters Mikenas and Aronin. Nevertheless, drawing few games, I
was still a contender for first place. This continued until my game with
Korchnoi, who was playing splendidly. The pairings had placed Spassky and
myself next to each other in the tournament table, and now Korchnoi first
defeated Boris with Black, and then me with White, when he boldly and
confidently left himself only seconds for his last few moves, but on the other
hand had everything weighed up! --- This game evidently made such demands on
Victor's stamina, that towards the end of the tournament he played much less
strongly. I scored 4½ points from my last 5 games, but this was sufficient
only to enable me to share 2nd-3rd places with Taimanov, half a point behind
Korchnoi. There was some consolation for me (although I did not consider that
I had performed badly) in the form of several special prizes, including one
for the most interesting game played in the Championship.}) 1-0

{The New Year, 1963, found me in hospital. An examination had shown that a
repeat operation was necessary. It was carried out by a pupil of the late
Professor Frumkin, who, according to his teacher, was knowledgeable. The
operation took place in Moscow, and on this occasion a thorough job was made
of it, since in the first half of the year I had nothing especially important
planned in chess. The operation was completed successfully, and after leaving
hospital I remained in Moscow, trying my hand for the first time in a new
field, as chess correspondent for the paper Soviet Sport, during the match for
the chess crown between Botvinnik and Petrosian. It was with pleasure that I
'avenged' myself upon my colleagues, discovering in analysis their mistakes.
My first experience showed me that the work was difficult, interesting, and
beneficial. It also had repercussions of a purely chess nature. Whereas
earlier I had played 1 e4 and 1 d4 on the first move with roughly equal
frequency, two months of observing the problems of isolated and hanging pawns
left me so sated with their taste, that for a long time after this I simply
avoided 1 d4. --- In the summer, the time came for me myself to play, and I
realised that sometimes a lengthy chess starvation can be beneficial. I
travelled with Bronstein to Miskolc, where my play was easy and unrestrained,
which is apparent if only from the games against Ghitescu and Bilek given in
this book. --- I practically assured myself of first place some 3-4 rounds
before the finish. Then the USSR Peoples' Spartakiad was held once again. My
result was more satisfactory than the one three years earlier, but our team
only reached the second final group, not the main one, and so for part of the
event I was playing against less experienced masters. Nevertheless, several of
the games proved to be of interest.} 39. -- ({The positioning of the black
pieces appears dubious, and if White had chosen, say,} 39. a4 {, radically
preventing the counterblow ...b5, he could hardly have lost.}) ({However, the

39. c5 $2 Bxf1 40. cxb6 Rxb6 41. Na4 Rb5 $1 42. Kxf1 Nxd4 43. Rxd4 Nc6 {, and

account of} 46. Rxd7+ {.}) ({However, the quiet} 45... Ke7 $1 {would suddenly
reveal that White's spectacular combination has led only to his defeat.})) (39.
-- {In the second half of the year I took greater steps to make up for my
previous lack of activity, and took part in a further three tournaments. The
first was in Havana. Not without a certain trepidation, caused by memories of
Curaçao, I flew across the ocean, but on this occasion my kidneys behaved
themselves perfectly. The tournament itself can be put down in my chess
biography as one of those in which I was satisfied with the result, but in no
way with my play. --- The participants were very varied in strength, and if
one's game is 'overworked' this is always dangerous. When, in the first round,
I failed to win a won pawn(!!) ending against Pachman, and in the second round
overcame Jimenez only with difficulty, and not really deservedly, much became
clear to me. Nevertheless, taking into account the fact that, in order to win
in such a mixed tournament of Grandmasters, masters, candidate masters and
even first category players (measuring according to standards familiar to me),
a high percentage of points would be required, I tried to take a hold on
myself. As a result I drew few games, but lost three. One of these was as
White to Trifunovic. I was already well acquainted with his tenacity, and
before the game Geller and I selected one of the variations of the Queen's
Gambit, but while the high-speed lift was taking us from the 28th floor of the
hotel 'Havana Libre', where we were staying, to the ground floor, I suddenly
thought: 'Why play the Queen's Gambit when there is the King's?' I began to
play sharply, which is always not without its dangers, the more so when one is
playing 'creakily'. In short, by move 15 my position was already in ruins.
Although I felt that it would be worth offering a draw, for Trifunovic might
well accept - he had drawn all his games up till then! - I didn't have the
courage to make this 'move'. Some ten moves later I resigned. --- Somewhere in
the middle of the tournament came the important game between Korchnoi and
myself. Up till then I had hardly lost to him as Black, and after a very sharp
struggle this game also ended in a draw. And for a week, Korchnoi suddenly
stopped speaking to me. At the end of the week I lost to the Cuban Calero (it
was his only win) in a game where I twice had a completely won position, but
twice blundered, on the second occasion losing my queen. After this there was
still a draw to be had, but I blundered for the third and last time. The first
person who came to console me was Korchnoi. When I enquired as to what had
provoked his week-long hostility, he answered in his usual direct way: 'Well,
you see, I reckoned up, and decided that I would have to win against you,
otherwise you would take first place. No one thought that you would lose to
Calero!' --- Indeed, finishing with 8½ points out of 9, which included a
90-move win against Geller, I nevertheless ended up half a point behind
Korchnoi, as did Geller and Pachman. There was a great contrast between this,
the Capablanca Memorial Tournament, and the International Tournament which
started immediately after it in the Moscow Central Chess Club. Here my result
was roughly equivalent, but I was much more satisfied with my play. I am
inclined to think that the prize I received for interesting play was more or
less deserved. The reader can find two of the games, against Gligoric and
Padevsky, in this book.}) (39. -- {An amusing episode accompanied the start of
this tournament. The day before, on the birthday of one of my friends, by no
means a chess player, someone suddenly expressed the desire that in my game
with the Dutchman Kuijpers the following day I should sacrifice something.
'Which piece, and on which square would you like?', I asked jokingly. 'Well,
let's say a knight on e6' --- The following day I had naturally forgotten this
conversation, and my game with Kuijpers first proceeded quietly, and then
became more complicated in the time-scramble. I made a move, and with
time-trouble over, Kuijpers realised that mate was inevitable, and resigned.
In the foyer my delighted friends gathered round. --- 'Good man! Did you do it
on purpose?' --- 'Do what?' --- 'Well, make that last move with your knight to
e6?' --- I immediately remembered, and realised that my chess prestige in
these circles had risen sharply, and so as to maintain this, I pompously asked:
'What would you like me to sacrifice tomorrow, and where?' --- For a moment my
friends were taken aback, and since no recommendation was given, my draw in
the second round was put down to their 'indifference' to me. --- I would also
like to mention the difference in my play with White and Black in this
tournament, rather unusual for me. As White I drew only one game, but as Black
I lost one game and drew the remainder, including one against the Polish
player Balcerowski who finished last. --- Two of the other encounters are also
worth recalling: those with Smyslov and Liberzon. During the first stage of
our chess 'relationship', when playing against Vasily Vasilyevich, I was
terribly afraid of transposing into an endgame. Here as Black I calmly went
into an ending, and one that was somewhat inferior. Up to a certain point
Smyslov played brilliantly, and achieved a great deal, and in desperation I
gave up the exchange without gaining the slightest compensation. Then Smyslov
decided to convert his advantage into a win without giving me the slightest
counter-chance, and began playing somewhat listlessly, whereupon my king
penetrated into the white position onto the square e3. At the time of the
sealed move, I was even of the opinion that Black's chances were by no means
worse. --- This was not shaken even by the radio report, which said that
Smyslov was the exchange ahead, and had a winning position.}) *

{JOURNALIST. Who was the commentator? --- CHESS PLAYER. Not you, not you,
don't get alarmed. --- Evidently Smyslov did not believe the radio assessment
of the position either, for the day before the resumption he offered a draw.
--- My one nought in the table came in my game against Liberzon, when - and
this happens to me - in an equal and quiet ending with opposite-coloured
bishops I simply lost patience. We were playing in the small room of the
Central Chess Club, from where it was easy to go up to the spectators, and
Liberzon, after making a move, immediately went over to his family who were in
the hall, and began talking in very lively style with them about something.
This suddenly infuriated me, and in quite ridiculous fashion I began playing
for a win, which, as is well known, is almost always equivalent to playing for
a loss. --- My third individual tournament in a row was the Championship of
Moscow University in lightning chess, in which some of our guests,
participants in the Central Chess Club Tournament, took part. Of the 19 games
I lost one, drew none, and came ahead of Kholmov (who took second place) by 2½ points. ---

Qxf3 Qxf3 36. Nc4 g4 {. For me the year 1964 was to be sated with chess. I
started it, and spent the whole of it, sitting at the chessboard. It was in a
'new country' for me, England, that I saw the New Year in, at the ancient
International Tournament held in Hastings. --- Here everything reminded one of
chess and non-chess battles. William the Conqueror, the victory of Harry
Nelson Pillsbury in the famous tournament of 1895. How much I was to read
about all this! --- The tournament went well for me, although in view of the
short distance (at that time the Hastings Tournament always comprised five
English players and five foreigners) I was rather afraid of a recurrence of my
old illness - a loss in the first round. Just imagine trying to catch up after
such a slip! --- The contenders for first place were the old hand of the
tournament: the Yugoslav Grandmaster Svetozar Gligoric, and its debutante
myself. Neither of us was defeated, but I won one game more. Hastings took a
leaf, as it were, out of Havana: there was nothing to boast about regarding my
play. An exception should perhaps be made of my game with Gligoric, in which a
place was found for an attack, a counter-attack, a combination and a
counter-combination. --- Apart from myself and the master Khasin, the Soviet
Chess Federation also sent the young Lady World Champion, Nona Gaprindashvili,
to Hastings to play in a secondary tournament. At that time she was still a
first-year student of English. --- She was, of course, the centre of general
attention, but we helped her to overcome her embarrassment, and in addition A.
Khasin, a professional teacher of English, would reply to the endless
questions from journalists. I recall the question which Nona was asked
particularly often: 'What do you think of English men?' At first Nona used to
answer with embarrassment, and not altogether tactfully: 'Not much, thank
you!' Then one day she called me over, and asked me: 'Misha, it's awkward for
me; say that I like them, but that I like Georgian men better!' --- Directly
from England, Nona and I set off for Iceland. Gligoric also arrived, the
Icelandic Grandmaster Olafsson was included, together with a number of other
players, and we all played in one tournament: 13 men and one girl. --- Here
the Gligoric-Tal race began. The result was that I scored 12½ out of 13,
and Gligoric a point less.} (36... -- {Three rounds before the finish, the
interval was only half a point. Gligoric lost to me, winning his remaining
games, while I had somewhere played a draw. On this day a telegram arrived
from Moscow, saying that Nona had been awarded the title of Honoured Master of
Sport of the USSR, and as a senior colleague I arranged a small banquet, to
which a number of the competitors were invited. --- The following day I was
due to play Nona. I didn't think that at that moment I had the right to play
for a win, and so I said to the Lady Champion that I was not averse to
agreeing a draw. To my surprise, Nona displayed her character, and said that,
in view of the close battle for first place, I was obliged to play only for a
win. --- Then I suggested to her that she should name an opening which she
would like me to play, she agreed to this and, naturally without any
additional preparation, I sat down at the board. I now felt more confident,
and even had the right to think of revenge. --- The point was that a New Year
lightning tournament had been held in Hastings, and in the final of this Nona
had scored 3 out of 3, and I only 2. --- I gained my revenge in Reykjavik, and
in the course of play I was once more made aware of the Georgian lady's
champion-like character. Already a pawn down, Nona got into time-trouble, but
when, not wishing to win on time, I 'forgot' to press my clock on a couple of
occasions, Nona said to me in a hissing whisper: 'If you do that again, I'll
resign straight away!' --- Then, in the penultimate round, I won my most
interesting game of the tournament against Olafsson, Gligoric drew, and the
question of first place was decided. --- Then, after a six-year interval, I
once again took part in an Interzonal Tournament. --- Once again the battle
was to finish in the first six, and to come ahead of at least two compatriots:
of the five Soviet Grandmasters, the door to the Candidates cycle was to be
opened to only three.}) (36... -- {In addition, there was the
not-exactly-clever rule of the forced draw (Editor's note: Players from one
country were given pairing numbers so that they played each other as early as
possible in the tournament. This meant that these players had consecutive
numbers in the draw, and consequently the remaining players often had to play 
(say) five or six Soviet Grandmasters in succession.), and it was very
important at which stage of the tournament a player would encounter the
'Russian row'. For Larsen, for instance, it occurred at the finish, when he
had already assured himself of a place in the first six, and therefore he was
able to play calmly. Gligoric was less fortunate: he played against the Soviet
Grandmasters earlier and, after dropping several points, became nervous. For
us too, it was not very pleasant to have to play one difficult game after
another without a break. --- My game in the second round with Portisch gave me
a number of difficult moments, and later even became tragi-comic. Having
decided that the most important thing was to play the opening originally, I
fully succeeded in my intention but then had to sacrifice to maintain the fire.
Portisch captured my pieces, and I, with nothing to lose, broke up his king's
position by the advance of my rook's pawn. At some point Portisch could have
allowed me to win his queen, gaining for it almost a complete set of the other
pieces, but he did not want this, and in a severe time-scramble we repeated
the position. --- When the draw had been agreed, Portisch somewhat perplexedly
asked me whether he could have played better. I just waved my hands. --- Later,
when he had cooled down after the game, Portisch admitted that he had been
expecting my capitulation at any moment, and the fact that I did not resign
had put the normally calm Hungarian Grandmaster out of his stride. --- This
game did me a good practical service. A year later we met in the Candidates
Matches, and it was our game from the Interzonal that showed me, firstly, that
Portisch was somewhat afraid of me, and, secondly, that such play could
confuse my erudite, experienced and formidable opponent. --- To return to the
Interzonal, after five draws at the start against the Soviet Grandmasters and
Portisch, I managed to win several games, and finished the tournament in
1st-4th places. I thus became one of the Candidates, but was not especially
pleased with the 'Battle of Amsterdam'.}) (36... -- {JOURNALIST. Is your play
affected when you have to set yourself a goal in an event? --- CHESS PLAYER.
More likely it is affected by a different sort of stimulus. Perhaps if I had
lost one of the games where I had a very dubious position, to Portisch,
Foguelman or Gligoric, everything would have turned out differently. As it was,
my results in the tournament table had a rather grey appearance. With those
who finished in the upper half, I drew, while the 'tail' was 'cut off'. One of
the more or less interesting games, with Evans, is given here. --- Besides
this, I was given great pleasure by the first game in my life with the veteran
S. Reshevsky. Prior to this, I had read that the American Grandmaster did not
devote a great deal of attention to the opening, and that in his youth he had
been very formidable in time-scrambles. Now, on the strength of my own
experience, I became convinced of the 100% accuracy of this characterisation.
This was one of the few games where I succeeded in catching my opponent in a
prepared variation, which, strange as it may seem, is contrary to my normal
way of playing. --- It is one thing, when you yourself are playing from the
first few minutes, and something quite different when the game begins at about
move 20, as it did against Reshevsky. Everyone reckoned that the end was in
sight, for my positional advantage was considerable, and the difference in
time simply colossal. On these 20 moves I had spent about 10 minutes, which
was necessary for the purely technical operations of writing down the move,
moving the piece, and pressing the clock, while Reshevsky had only 15 minutes
left! Taking all this into account, I was physically unable to force myself to
deal the finishing blow with the necessary energy. I began playing from
inertia, as it were, whereas time after time Reshevsky would discover
exceptional defensive resources. Then I sacrificed a piece, whereupon the game
became tactical, and I was greatly impressed by the way that Reshevsky, with
1-2 minutes for 10 moves, would hold his hand over the board and quite
impulsively grasp the very piece that was required, and make with it the only
saving move. Finally, in a more or less equal position, Reshevsky offered me a
draw. I had also read that he would do this when he was in a bad position, and
I searched very carefully for what Reshevsky might be afraid of. I found
nothing, agreed to a draw, and then the American Grandmaster revealed that it
wasn't the position on the board that he was afraid of, but the opponent - at
any rate, during this game. --- Taking into account the specific nature of the
tournament, the position before the 22nd and penultimate round remained tense:
at least four of the five Soviet Grandmasters had real chances of success.
Someone had to be the 'superfluous fourth', and it was Leonid Stein who
stumbled. For the second time running he did not reach the Candidates because
of the discrimination, although he took a place which was sufficient for any
non-Soviet player. In the last round, the Bulgarian Grandmaster Tringov
literally forced me, with his risky play, to carry out a combination with a
sacrifice of two pieces, although at this moment there was no real need to
take any risks (see the following game).}) 0-1

{The year ended for me in Kiev, where I participated in the USSR Championship.
--- Here, unfortunately, I caught a cold, which made itself felt. In the first
round it was by no means because of this that I lost to Bronstein, in a game
from which I gained enormous pleasure. The manoeuvre of Black's king from e8
to f6 simply staggered me. --- After this failure at the start, followed by a
few draws, I reached the 50% level by winning against Vasiukov. In this game,
I spent 40 minutes on my 19th move 'dragging the hippopotamus out of the
marsh', which I have talked about earlier. --- In the next round I was once
again down to '-1', then two rounds later up to '+ 1', and after the 9th round
I fell ill. The day before, I had adjourned my game against Korchnoi, and on
subsequent resumption a drawn position was reached: rook and pawn against
bishop and pawn. Since it was Korchnoi who had the rook, we carried on playing.
On and on we played, and just when I could have saved the half point
practically as I pleased, he nevertheless 'outplayed' me: I chose for my
bishop almost the only losing square, and there arose a new theoretical
position, but this time with a different assessment. --- Under the doctor's
instructions, I played several of the games in my hotel room. The majority of
my opponents readily agreed to this, realising that it was not I who was being
capricious, but others proved less compliant, and insisted that play should
take place only in the tournament hall. Need it be said that I doubled my
efforts in these games, and won them both. In winning against Shamkovich, I
seriously spoiled his tournament position: up till then he had been amongst
the leaders. With Sakharov also, the game proved to be fairly 'ruthless'. ---
The majority of the commentators assessed my overall result (3rd place) as
quite good, taking into account my illness, but there were no special creative
achievements. I will give only the concluding attack against Shamkovich.} 32.

{When I drew the number 13 in the Havana Tournament, the other players, the
controllers and spectators greeted this with jovial applause. Strictly
speaking, I had no grounds for complaining of any obvious ill fortune in the
tournament, and I would even say that, prior to the game given below, I had
more points than I deserved. Even so, for player number 13 the 13th round is
dangerous. I suspect that, having successfully negotiated this hurdle, (this
was the critical game) I was so inspired by this achievement that the
following day I lost to a player, who thus obtained, as it turned out at the
end of the tournament, his only win. It seems that there are other numbers
which are also dangerous ...} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 5. c3 {

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d5 {The sharp, impulsive play of my opponent has gained him
widespread popularity in chess circles, but on this occasion (whether or not
with the aim of maintaining his reputation) he chooses an over-sharp
continuation. Perhaps the fact that Lutikov had been successful in our
previous encounters played a certain role in the choice of this variation,
together with the considerable psychological effect of the novelty. Indeed, I
had never previously encountered in tournament practice the position after
Black's 2nd move. White's first task was at least to remember the name of this
opening. At the board I did not succeed in solving this problem. The second
was to recall any games previously played with this variation. With this
second problem I coped rather more successfully. There flashed through my mind
the encounter between Boleslavsky and Lilienthal (Match-Tournament for the
title of Absolute Champion of the USSR, 1941) and the notes by Botvinnik to
this game, from which it was clear that the move played by Boleslavsky, 3 Nxe5,
is not the strongest (after it Black could have equalised) and that 3 exd5
should be played. --- A game by Konstantinopolsky from the World
Correspondence Team Championship was published in one of the chess yearbooks
in which the Soviet master played 3 exd5, and won. Thus equipped with a solid
theoretical support, I decided to follow Botvinnik's recommendation.} 3. exd5

sacrifices:} 4... Nf6 5. d3 Be7 6. dxe4 O-O {.}) 5. d3 Nf6 6. dxe4 fxe4 7. Nc3

{This game was played in the last round, with two players - Stein and I - in
joint first position, while Grandmaster Averbakh was just half a step behind.
Thus White's tactics appeared to be simple enough - play for a win, avoid
losing, and follow the events on the neighbouring board (where Averbakh was
playing Stein). It is well known that Master Fuchs (along with many other
leading East German players) invariably answers 1 e4 with 1...e6, and has
frequently upheld Black's cause in the most intricate variations. Not feeling
inclined to conduct a theoretical discussion on 'French' affairs, I decided to
go in for another topical variation (the so-called 'Meran'), which also occurs
frequently in Fuchs's games, and whose complications I consider to be very
attractive for White.} 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e3 Bf5 {Here White felt
dejected. His psychology had 'worked', but this move is just what he did not
want. In place of a sharp struggle he has prospects of some dreary queenside
pressure. Nevertheless ...} 5. cxd5 cxd5 ({Markedly weaker is} 5... Nxd5 {
because of} 6. Bc4 e6 7. Nge2 {soon to be followed by a comfortable pawn
advance in the centre.}) 6. Qb3 ({With} 6. Qb3 {, White was wearily expecting
the natural (although at the same time paradoxical)} Bc8 {, after which it is
very difficult for White to exploit his lead in development.}) 6... Qb6 {...and the searching through my memory began. Unless White wishes to concede that
he has not a shade of an advantage, he must accept the challenge (and take the
pawn).} 7. Nxd5 Nxd5 8. Qxd5 Qb4+ ({After} 8... Qb4+ {I at last remembered
where I had seen this position before. In 1957 the Soviet student team, on its
way back from Reykjavik, played a match against Denmark in Copenhagen. The
experienced master Enevoldsen adopted this same sharp system against Averbakh.
As far as I remember the game continued} 9. Bd2 Qxb2 {, and here Averbakh
dampened his opponent's spirits by playing} 10. Qb5+ {. The ending turned out
to be somewhat to White's advantage. As I found out after the game, my
opponent had observed this variation during a match between East Germany and
Denmark. Black had been the same Enevoldsen, while White had been Uhlmann. In
this game also an ending was quickly reached after White forced the exchange
of queens. It seems to me that White's advantage in the centre, together with
the fact that he can quickly bring his pieces into play, should encourage him
to keep the struggle complicated. The one inconvenient feature of his position
is the awkward situation of his queen in the centre of the board. This can be
easily removed, if the queen is sacrificed.}) 9. Bd2 ({In my opinion,} 9. Kd1
Bd7 {gives Black more than sufficient play for his pawn.}) 9... Qxb2 10. Rc1
Bd7 11. Nf3 e6 12. Qc4 $1 {The imminent opposition of the queen with Black's
rook, which will soon move to c8, is relatively harmless for White.} Nc6 13.
Be2 {After lengthy reflection, White all the same agrees to the exchange of
queens. True, the ending here is much more favourable for him than in the
variation chosen by Averbakh, since Black has had to waste further time.} ({
Instead of 13 Be2, very tempting was} 13. Bd3 {, when} Bb4 {does not achieve
its aim in view of} 14. Rb1 {.}) ({The following interesting variation could

{Once again the Caro-Kann... --- In their search for a sound defence against
the 'rust-proof 1 e4, players with Black have been turning more and more
frequently to the (until quite recently) 'half-forgotten' Caro-Kann Defence.
The army of supporters of this opening has already received such
'reinforcements' as Botvinnik and Smyslov, while the present World Champion 
(Petrosian) has been fond of the move 1...c6 'since childhood'. At the start
of the 32nd USSR Championship, Vasiukov was also enlisted into the Caro-Kann
legions. However, his debut in this opening did not turn out very successfully.

old-fashioned system, reckoning that, in order to defend accurately, Black
would require not only knowledge of the opening variation, but also experience,

its presence!}) 10. Nf3 O-O 11. Qe2 b6 {The first, though as yet not
particularly significant, inaccuracy. The place for the black queen in this

only due to begin in the summer. Both then and now I could not imagine my

take part in the Latvian Championship, where I assumed the role of favourite.} 
1. -- {JOURNALIST. Let us suppose for the moment that you had a perfectly free
choice of events, and you could play 365 games a year if you wished. How many
would you play, and with what intervals? --- CHESS PLAYER. It's a purely
theoretical question. Sometimes after a tournament I feel so tired that I
promise myself that I won't touch chess at all for a certain length of time.
But a week or 10 days pass, and I once again feel myself being drawn to the
board. So after each tournament, I think that an interval of two weeks, or a
maximum of three, is quite sufficient.} (1. -- {JOURNALIST. So you would play
in ten tournaments a year?! --- CHESS PLAYER. Well, what of it? That is what I
did in the period from 1972 to 1974, and I didn't feel in the least unhappy.})
(1. -- {JOURNALIST. Korchnoi once wrote that to keep in good form he has to
play 80 games a year... --- CHESS PLAYER. I need more. A minimum of 100,
since calculating play requires constant practice, although, strange as it may
seem, I am not a particularly 'calculating' player. --- The first rounds of
the Latvian Championship were spent 'warming up' after a long period of chess
inactivity. I played quietly, with the accent on technique. --- This gave
pleasure neither to me, nor to the fans, and I 'switched styles', after which
I succeeded with several quite attractive attacks.}) *

one point, and by playing on in the last round until there were only the kings
left, I became the Champion of Latvia, regaining this title after a 12-year
interval. --- In the summer came the Candidates Matches. We prepared very
thoroughly for my first opponent, Portisch, who at that time was already
considered an opening specialist, and whose style resembled that of Botvinnik.
Hoping for success, and knowing that the semi-final Matches were due to begin
only a week after the quarter-finals, at the same time we made some
preparations for a match with Ivkov, reckoning that he would win against
Larsen. Our assumption was reinforced by the recent tournament in Zagreb,
where Larsen had lost some five games, including one to Ivkov in about twenty
moves. --- The one thing that we were somewhat guarded about was the shortness
of the matches: 10 games. Up till that time I had played one match of 14 games
with Saigin, and two of up to 24 games with Botvinnik. Perhaps for this reason
my trainer forbade me to play the King's Indian Defence against Portisch, so
as not to take an unnecessary risk, and thus find myself in the position of
having to win one back. We assumed that Portisch would prepare especially
thoroughly against the King's Indian. As White I decided to play only 1 e4,
since against this move the Hungarian Grandmaster defended less confidently.
From the creative point of view, I was quite delighted with these two matches,
against Portisch and Larsen.}) 1-0

{The first match, with Portisch, began with a score of +2 -1 =2 in my favour,
and to some extent set the tone for the whole match. As Black I equalised
fairly quickly, and adjourned the game in a slightly favourable ending.
According to the regulations, adjournments were to be played off after every
two games, and so the second game began with a certain moral advantage on my
side, especially since match play has its own specific form: as White you try
for success, and as Black for equality. --- Here Portisch surprised me: in the
second game, for evidently the first time in his life, he chose the Caro-Kann
Defence. To me, such a blatant copying of Botvinnik seemed somewhat guileless,
and when in my turn I avoided the well beaten path, Portisch found himself in
an unfamiliar situation. He played inaccurately, I played sharply, and the
reader can see for himself how it all turned out. --- On the resumption of the
first game, I missed a win on the 56th move, the last one before the time
control, and then in the third game played badly in an absolutely level
position, overlooked a simple manoeuvre by White, and Portisch played the
remainder of the game very accurately, although it too was unfinished after
the first session. --- The fourth game is also given in this book, and I would
merely like to give the conversation which I had with Portisch when we were
analysing it afterwards. The point is that at some stage I had to choose
between transposing into a technically better, perhaps even won position, with
a knight on d4 against a bishop on d7 and an isolated black pawn at d5, or
playing for an attack. I chose the latter. --- Here Portisch asked me why I
hadn't played differently at this point, with Rd3. I replied that the move
hadn't even entered my head. He looked at me in astonishment, and said that I
had already played this move in an earlier game. It was my turn to be
astonished. 'Where? When?' 'At Curaçao, against Benko!' --- Yes, Portisch had
prepared conscientiously for our match. --- The day finished with a score of
1-1, for straight after this game I resigned the adjournment with a quiet mind
... --- It was perhaps the fifth game that proved decisive. Once again the
Nimzo-Indian Defence, and a variation which was not expected of me: the only
time I had played it previously was in the 1953 USSR Youth Championship. As it
turned out, Portisch was 'in general' prepared for it, and it was he who
surprised me by offering a sacrifice of the exchange. I found the correct
reply, and a sharp ending was reached, in which, towards the time control,
Portisch succeeded in outplaying me. --- Nearly two whole days were devoted to
the analysis of this position. It was published in full in the Riga magazine
'Shakhmaty' - the editorial staff always 'forced' its editor not only to give
directional guidance, but also to write conscientiously about all the events
in which he, that is I, took part. It is not possible to give the full
analysis here, nor is it necessary, and I will limit myself to just the main
line. Portisch sealed} 41. e4 $1 {, the only move to give him any winning
chances. There followed} Rxh2+ 42. Ke3 Bf7 43. Rb6 Rh5 $1 {, and after half an
hour's thought White replied} 44. f5 {, which forced Black from the road of
analysis onto the path of improvisation.} ({What a pity! The game could have
finished beautifully if White had chosen the sharp} 44. e5 fxe5 45. f5 {, with

theoretically drawn position is reached, where the rook and pawn cannot win
against the bishop.}) (44. -- {After Portisch's move, the game was drawn
without any particular trouble. Before the last three games I still had a lead
of one point, but the previous game had evidently overtaxed Portisch, for he
played without any great enthusiasm, and I won both as Black in the 7th game,
and as White in the eighth. This gave me the necessary 5½ points ahead of
schedule. --- After a break of a week came the semi-final match. I have
already said that Larsen's victory over Ivkov came as a surprise to us, and
Larsen is the sort of opponent against whom one must either prepare very
carefully, or else play spontaneously. --- In view of the lack of time, the
first variation was ruled out, and we realised that the match was going to
prove very difficult, although the score from previous encounters was clearly
in my favour: +3 -0 =2. --- So, in an optimistic frame of mind, I played the
King's Indian Defence in the first game, with the permission of my second.
This attempt was to be the first and the last. It turned out that Larsen was
very well prepared, and played much more strongly against me than he had
against Uhlmann in the recent Zagreb Tournament. --- He adopted a new, very
interesting order of moves, which set Black extremely complex problems. Then,
however, I was surprised that, instead of deciding the game by combinative
means, Larsen, contrary to his usual habit, played very reservedly, and
practically allowed me to equalise. Here I began to think of more, remembered
the score of our previous encounters, and after missing good drawing chances,
once again got into a lost position. Larsen was once again unhurried, but this
time inexorable. I postponed my resignation until the day the game was resumed.

{The following day the unexpected happened. Larsen decided to play too openly
for a draw. The fact is that there are very many players in the world who can
play for a win, but very few who can draw to order, especially as Black.
Larsen certainly cannot be considered one of them, and the penultimate game of
the Ivkov-Larsen match is a further indication of this. --- What became of
Larsen's desire can be seen from the game, which is given here in the book.
Thus the score became 1-1. Then came two draws, one of which, the 4th game,
affected me badly, and left its mark on my play in the 5th game. --- In the
match with Ivkov, Larsen had adopted the Alekhine Defence in one game, and it
had also occurred in his previous games. In our game, after} 1. e4 Nf6 2. e5
Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. Nf3 dxe5 {To some extent a Larsen patent.} 5. Nxe5 {, he
suddenly played} Nd7 {. If this had been in a simultaneous display, I would
have decided that my opponent had simply overlooked the stroke} 6. Nxf7 Kxf7 7.
Qh5+ {, when, against his will, the black king is forced to go for a walk. ---
Larsen could not have missed this, and I began examining the possible
variations, which were, of course, pretty complicated, Intuition kept telling
me that the sacrifice could not be incorrect. However, I decided to calculate
everything 'as far as mate', studied one variation, a second, a third... 50
minutes went by in this way, and most of the time was spent in searching for a
defence for Larsen, whom I nevertheless trusted. Finally, in one of the
innumerable variations, I naturally succeeded in finding something resembling
a defence. --- Of course, the position did not require such consideration.
Either my opponent's 'offer' should have been immediately declined, or else
the problem should have been tackled without prejudice, and the knight
sacrificed at f7. In fact I rejected the sacrifice after prolonged thought,
and this was a psychological blunder, for even after I had gained the
advantage, my thoughts kept returning to the 'critical' position. Somewhere in
the middle of the game, I suddenly came to the conclusion that in a variation
I had examined, and which I had thought to be in Black's favour, White in fact
gains a decisive advantage. This I could not endure, and I played the second
part of the game aimlessly, which led after 40 moves to a lost ending. Then I
had to seal my move. I thought for over half an hour, I even wanted to resign,
but Larsen was no longer on the stage. --- In a gloomy mood we sat down to
analyse, and began with the position after... Black's 5th move. We convinced
ourselves that 6 Nxf7 would have given White a very strong attack, and went on
to the adjourned position. Considering it to be hopeless, we lazily moved the
pieces about. At about three in the morning, owing to Koblents's extreme
tiredness, I managed to draw a couple of times, and I joked that now Larsen
would be unable to win the ending. Thus a small though, to be honest, rather
dubious degree of optimism arose. --- In addition, however, at some stage play
could transpose into an ending, very slightly similar to the games
Botvinnik-Fischer and Portisch-Tal, where separated pawns successfully fought
against two connected passed pawns in a rook ending. This also gave us a
certain amount of hope. --- Nevertheless, what saved me was no doubt the fact
that Larsen thought that he could win the game just as he pleased. At the
decisive moment Black's eyes were 'dazzled', and when the second time control
was reached at move 56, the position was already drawn.} (7. -- {The game as a
whole somehow unsettled me, and for the fifth game I extracted from my arsenal
the Grünfeld Defence, which I had prepared for the match with Portisch. I have
always liked it in a platonic way, but previously I had played it only a few
times, and with no great success. --- Although, as the game went, I could have
gained equality without difficulty, I once again began dreaming of more, which
finally led to a retreat. On this occasion Larsen demonstrated his technical
ability, and to adjourn the game seemed improper. Thus Larsen went into the
lead. --- On the day before the sixth game, Larsen's wife, who was able to
affect Bent's mood like no one else, left Yugoslavia. Whether it was for this
reason or some other is not clear, but the score was immediately levelled (the
game is given here) and the tension reached breaking point. --- The seventh
was, in my opinion, the most interesting, sharp and fruitful game of the match,
though it was not without its mistakes. Larsen did not gain any opening
advantage, and got into serious time-trouble, in which I became nervous, and
for some unknown reason rejected the win of a piece. Then one of us blundered,
the other returned the compliment, and we adjourned the game, so as to resume
it, according to the schedule, after the 8th game. --- In analysis we found
that, practically by force, an ending could be reached with rook and pawn
against knight and pawn. In Averbakh's book on the endgame, we found exactly
this position, with the diagnosis - draw, and began looking to see how we
could avoid it. Suddenly I thought of an idea by which we might disprove
Averbakh. After long searching we decided that we had managed to do this. ---
This meant that in the three remaining games, in two of which I had the white
pieces, I could play calmly! I adjourned the 8th game with a purely symbolic
advantage, which was impossible to realise, and then resumed the 7th game. It
turned out that, after all, it was not so simple to refute the theoretical
findings, and as a result the score remained level. --- Thus we were back
where we started, and everything depended on the last two games. And if the
score should be 1-1? The seconds and the chief controller, the likeable and
witty Austrian Dorazil, discussed this, for the moment theoretical but
perfectly real possibility. They could not come to an agreement (playing to
the first win was not practised at that time in the Candidates matches, and
first occurred 9 years later in a Ladies' Match) and so Dorazil made the
following suggestion: 'It will all be very simple. I will stand Larsen and Tal
side by side, and give each of them a sheep's bone, and then bring in my dog.
The one he goes up to will go through to the final!!'}) (7. -- {The
controller's decision was 'accepted' with delight, and play continued. --- The
9th game also proved to be dramatic. At the board I found an important
rejoinder to an opening surprise (at least, that is what it was for me) by
Larsen, and by about move 15 already considered that I could play for a win.
In addition, Larsen once again spent a great deal of time in thought. --- Here
nerves came into the act. At first I committed some inaccuracies, and then in
Larsen's time-trouble made such a move that my position immediately became
hopeless. When, after the game, Koblents asked Larsen to comment on the move
24...g5, the Dane replied: 'For several minutes I thought that Tal had gone
mad!' --- Indeed, there is no other word for this move but mad. Larsen
immediately gained a menacing attack, and after the time-scramble and its
inevitable slips, we adjourned the game in an ending which was inferior, and
most probably lost for me. Larsen was a pawn ahead with a good position, and
could do what he liked. --- The one thing that we were able to find in
analysis was a rather simple trap. --- Larsen fell into it! Although the
adventures did not end there, and we both in turn made further mistakes, a
theoretically drawn ending was reached. --- Thus before the last game I had an
advantage not only in the form of the white pieces, but also in that my
spirits were raised. Besides, at that time I had faith in my ability to play
decisive games. --- The reader can see for himself how the battle was decided.
--- I must admit that I returned home in high spirits, although they could
have been dampened by the fact that in the final I had to meet Boris Spassky,
against whom the chess score was far from in my favour.}) (7. -- {JOURNALIST.
Incidentally, which of the Candidates would you have preferred to meet in the
final? --- CHESS PLAYER. If one goes by bare arithmetic, I had a plus score
against Geller and Smyslov. As they had already played each other in the
quarter-finals, the chance of me meeting a 'pleasant' opponent was not all
that high.}) (7. -- {JOURNALIST. You are, after all, of an emotional nature,
but in matches you see before you the same face, day after day... --- CHESS
PLAYER. It is for this reason that even now I prefer tournaments. --- Even if,
in a match, my opponent's face is the most likeable. --- Before describing the
match in Tbilisi, I must 'complain' that my preparations for it were ruined by
medical considerations. The doctors discovered something completely imaginary 
(as it later turned out) in my lungs, and virtually insisted that I should be
sent to the Crimea. In addition, they stated categorically that the match
should take place only in Yalta. I flatly refused to agree to this, since
after a very friendly correspondence with Spassky, I had suggested Tbilisi,
and he had agreed. I have no doubt that Boris would have come to Yalta if I
had asked him to, but to play in a sanatorium... Ugh! --- Prior to the match,
Koblents came to Yalta, along with L. Shamkovich, who also helped me in my
preparations. Occupied with all kinds of medical procedures, I did not spend a
great deal of time at the board. In addition, it was only later that I
realised that all this endless manipulation and swallowing of medicines did
not exactly assist the development of my creative fantasy, or even put me in a
good frame of mind. --- Then the match started. The first game straight away
featured an interesting move by Spassky, for whom the three encounters of 1965,
and the four (including the match with Petrosian) of 1968/9 were to be the
summit of his achievements. --- This glory must rightly be shared with I.
Bondarevsky, an excellent trainer, who not only keenly senses the nuances of a
position, but also the psychological condition of his protégé and the opponent.
--- The interesting 'move' made by Spassky was to play the Marshall Attack in
the Ruy Lopez, and not just this by itself, but also the treatment given to
the attack by Spassky and Bondarevsky: giving up a pawn to avoid a sharp
calculating struggle. --- So, at the very start of the match, Boris gained the
initiative for a pawn, and at the same time a solid position. I attempted to
shake his position, and was successful, although analysis later revealed that
White had in fact played too riskily. I obtained the better ending, and had I
continued to conduct the game strategically I would have had quite good
winning chances. However, a combination with a purely study-like idea cropped
up, and without hesitation I temporarily sacrificed a piece, which, after
Spassky's precise and simple reply, gave me only a useless extra pawn in an
ending with opposite-coloured bishops. --- In the second game Spassky, who
like myself plays less strongly at the beginning of an event, miscalculated in
a sharp position, and came out a pawn down, and I won.}) (7. -- {JOURNALIST. I
have a photograph from the beginning of the third game. Spassky is sitting at
the board, bent low and ready to spring, as it were. He is a picture of
self-discipline, of a man striving to go forward. You are quite placidly
leaning back in your chair... is it possible that the third game, and the
match as a whole, was lost not by a chess player to a chess player, but by an
athlete to an athlete? --- CHESS PLAYER. Very possible! Although it would seem
that psychologically I lost the match somewhat later. --- In the third game,
Spassky avoided the Marshall Attack, for which we had prepared. --- White
should nevertheless have obtained a slight but comfortable and lasting opening
advantage, but I simply played the moves in the wrong order. The game went
into an equal ending, and I offered a draw. It was only after the match that I
found out that Bondarevsky had given Spassky strict instructions to play on in
such positions 'until Tal was sick of them'. The shrewd trainer was right: on
receiving a refusal and after some further 'moving about', I began to create
difficulties for myself, and adjourned the game a pawn down, although the draw
had not yet been thrown away. --- The resumption took place the following day.
Here again Spassky and Bondarevsky chose exactly the same unhurried tactics -
no forced variations! I had not the time left to do this - the previous day I
had used up half an hour on my clock. Here I worked out a long study-like
variation, and reached a position where Spassky would have a king and queen
against my king and a pawn on fl. And I boldly went in for it. But when this
position was just about to be reached, I realised that my king would not be on
g8, which would have given the draw, but on e8, and that when I queened the
pawn I would be mated. I was forced to change course, but for this it was
already too late.}) (7. -- {After the quiet fourth game, before which Spassky
gave me a present - it was played on my birthday - Spassky once again played
the Marshall Attack, committed an inaccuracy, and I obtained by force an
ending which was highly unpleasant for Black. Instead of playing 'a la
Spassky', and gradually realising my extra pawn over a large number of moves,
I was once again tempted by some concrete variations, exchanged all four rooks,
and then realised that in the resulting ending with opposite-coloured bishops
there was no longer a win. --- When, in the sixth game, by utilising one of
his opening weapons, Spassky just as quickly took play into an outwardly
harmless, but in fact slightly favourable ending for White, my nerves once
again could not stand the strain. Instead of equalising accurately, I 'rushed'
things, both of Spassky's rooks penetrated onto the eighth rank and we thought
that the adjourned position was lost. --- The one slim hope was that, if
Spassky had sealed the most natural move, then by a tactical stroke I could
exchange a pair of rooks, and although my position would remain unpleasant,
the draw would be there. --- Strange as it may seem, it was just this move
that Boris sealed! He then 'tormented' me for quite a long time (this followed
from his tactics in the match) but without result. --- Here it was that I made
a mistake. I was advised to avoid 1 e4 for the moment, especially since I had
prepared for many of Spassky's favourite schemes against 1 d4, but I became
obstinate. Besides, I was subconsciously counting on Spassky's former
inability to play decisive games (which had more than once let Boris down),
and I set myself the goal of maintaining the equilibrium until the penultimate
11th game. So, I thought, let him once again play the Marshall Attack, even
though I had not achieved anything against it so far! He played it, and what's
more found an improvement on his previous play, and deliberately took play
into a slightly inferior ending. However, the tactics planned by Spassky and
his trainer justified themselves. I gradually 'converted' the favourable
ending into one that was not altogether comfortable, but on resumption
nevertheless held the draw. --- In the eighth game Boris played slackly, and
Black quickly equalised. Perhaps if there had been two more draws, then
Spassky would have cracked, but it was I who did so first. In the ninth game I
made the half-hearted decision to play 1 e4, but not allow the Marshall Attack.
Boris played inaccurately, and White gained a considerable advantage, but in
striving for the 'planned' fifth point I got carried away. I began to demand
too much from myself, and what is more important, from the position, and
instead of first ensuring the safety of my king, I moved my rook off somewhere
and gave Spassky counterplay which he utilised splendidly. --- As a result the
game was adjourned in a lost position. Acting unhurriedly, and in
exaggeratedly academic fashion, Spassky realised his advantage. --- The
situation had now changed sharply. There were only three games to go to the
finish, in which I would have White in only one, and I had to win back a point.
--- In the tenth game, as early as the 3rd(!) move, Boris demonstrated his
unwillingness to get mixed up in anything at all risky, and instead it was I
who did this. --- I played unevenly, and badly, and the score became 6-4 in
Spassky's favour. --- As Spassky later told me, before the eleventh game, and
also during it, he was very nervous, but this did not prevent him from playing
his best game of the match. I organised a typical football 'pile-up' on the
black king's position, but gave up as lost the queenside and the centre. This
neglect of prophylaxis did not go unpunished, and the match concluded. ---
After this I went to see the Tbilisi doctors, where I found out that, firstly,
intense doses of all sorts of medicine do not go unnoticed either by the
kidneys or by the nerves, and secondly, that I was, according to the doctors,
perfectly healthy! I could only regret that the discussion between the
physicians from Riga and Tbilisi, which concluded in a victory for the latter
and for me, had not taken place a few months earlier.}) *

{I will not hide the fact that before the start of this game I was nervous.
The last time I had taken part in the Latvian Championship was seven years
previously, since when I had had practically no encounters at the chessboard
with our best players. Meanwhile, the class of their play had markedly risen.
It is not just a joke that in 1958 many participants were trying to reach the
candidate master norm, whereas now the norm had been set for obtaining the
title of master. One of the seekers of this title happened to be my opponent
in the first round. --- Of course, my participation in the Championship of the
Republic was purely for training purposes, in particular for working on my
opening repertoire and on the question of 'time'. Many observers criticised me
(and not without reason) for the fact that sometimes I play too quickly, and
at other times with the speed of an express tortoise. --- In the Championship
of the Republic I took the advice of D. Bronstein: to note down the time taken
over each move during the game. I think that this additional information can
help disclose the course of the players' thoughts during the game.} 1. c4 {(0.
01) --- It is curious, but until 1963 I was not such an ardent supporter of
the move 1 e4. After the Petrosian-Botvinnik match, on which I had to
commentate, I took to commencing all my games (apart from two it seems) in
this way, perhaps as a protest against the fact that for two months 1 e4 was
not once played. However, to be honest, in two years one can become tired of
this also.} (1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7.

} Nf6 {(0.05)} 3. g3 {(0.02)} c6 {(0.22) --- What was Black thinking about for
17 minutes? Perhaps he was refreshing his memory of the sharp variations
associated with the move in the game, or perhaps he was occupied with
psychological considerations. I have highly unpleasant recollections of the
move 3...c6 in connection with a terrible opening rout inflicted on me by
Botvinnik in the 9th game of our return match in 1961.} 4. Nf3 {(0.03)} d6 {(0.
25)} ({More critical is} 4... e4 5. Nd4 {, and now either} d5 ({or} 5... Qb6 {
. The move made by Zhuravlev leads to a variation which gives Black a solid
but rather unpromising game.})) 5. Bg2 {(0.05)} Be7 {(0.27) --- Black finally

White:} 8. b3 ({or} 8. e4 {there would simply have been a transposition of
moves, since the place for the queen in this variation is on c7. I wanted
somehow to punish my opponent for his opening liberty, and so there followed...
})) 8. c5 $6 {(0.15) --- White immediately starts a fight in the centre, but
this does not bring him any particular advantage. As my opponent rightly said
after the game: Black has done nothing wrong, so why this move all of a
sudden?! True, he now has to play carefully.} ({Bad after} 8. c5 -- ({is} 8...

move is by analogy with the well-known variation of the Ruy Lopez (see above);
it is curious how opening ideas repeat themselves.} ({After} 10. Bg5 {Black
has to meet the positional threat of} -- 11. dxe5 {, after which he either has
significantly to spoil his kingside, or else part with his king's bishop, when,
in an open position, the white bishops on g2 and, say, f4 will be highly
unpleasant 'observers' of the queenside.}) ({This threat can be met by} 10. Bg5
h6 {, after which Black need not fear} 11. dxe5 Bxe5 12. Nxe5 {because of} hxg5
{when the pawn on g5 helps him to complete his development successfully.}) ({
After} 10. Bg5 h6 11. dxe5 Bxe5 {, I was intending} 12. Bd2 {, so as to begin
active operations on the kingside (} Bd6 13. Rc1 {, forcing} Qb8 {).}) 10...
Be7 {(0.48) --- The strongest move. The position is not sufficiently open for
anything to be gained from this apparent loss of time. The task facing White
is by no means easy: to demonstrate the superiority of his position. In order
to do this, I spent 36 minutes on my next move, but perhaps I did not succeed
in completely solving the problem?!} 11. Qc2 {(0.53) --- White's aim is to
prevent the exchange on d4 followed by ...Ne5, after which Black has an easy
game.} ({In view of this the plausible} 11. Rc1 {is weaker, since after the
equally plausible move} Qa5 {the 'development' of White's rook is seen to be
no use at all.}) ({Players with inclinations towards technique might have
decided on the manoeuvre} 11. Bxf6 Bxf6 12. d5 -- ({, but I could not find
anything concrete after either the simple} 12... cxd5 13. Nxd5 Qd8 14. Nd2 ({or
} 14. Rc1 Nb6) 14... Nb6) ({, or} 12... Nb6 {, allowing the advance of the
pawn. After lengthy reflection I decided on the move 11 Qc2, firstly since I
had a vague picture of the variation which was to occur in the game, secondly
from general considerations (White is trying to establish a knight on f5 and
he frees the square d1 for a rook), and thirdly since I was intending to weigh
up once more an unusual possibility (cf. the note to White's 12th move).}))

considerable time, although 11...Qa5 could not have been unexpected.} ({Over

favourable post on h5. In the end I rejected this possibility because of} c5
16. Rab1 d3 $1 17. exd3 cxb4 18. axb4 Ne5 {, when the weakening of the white
king's pawn cover could play a significant role in such an open position.
Perhaps I should have played this, since subsequently I was to take measures
that were even more double-edged.}) 12... exd4 {(1.25) --- This seems to me to
be a waste of time on Black's clock. It is clear that he must play this, and
only this.} 13. Nxd4 {(1.10)} Qh5 {(1.28)} 14. Nf5 {(1.24) --- Black only
needs to play his knight to e5 for all his difficulties to be behind him.} ({
White decides to prevent this in the most radical way, by placing his pawn on
f4, which, incidentally, was bad straight away in view of} 14. f4 Bc5 {. Now
Black gets good counterplay thanks to the bizarre placing of the white pieces.}
) 14... Bd8 {(1.35)} (14... Bc5 15. Na4 {was much weaker. Black's king's
bishop is the bulwark of his position. He remembers this up to a certain point.

time. Now complications suddenly set in.} g6 $1 {(1.52) --- The most accurate.}
({The preparatory} 15... Bb6+ {gets Black nowhere after} 16. e3) ({while on}

'chamber'.}) 16. Nh4 {(1.26)} (16. Nd6 $2 Qc5+ {.}) 16... Ng4 {(1.55)} ({After

simply succeed in trapping his queen.}) 17. Ne4 {(1.29) --- It was on this
move that White had based his calculations.} ({On} 17. Nf3 {Black could have
won the exchange without any great fear:} Bb6+ 18. Kh1 Nf2+ {.}) 17... Bxh4 $2
{(2.14) --- After this positional mistake Black is, I think, lost. At the cost
of a not very important pawn, White is able to redeploy his pieces and
strengthen his kingside. The opening of the g-file, as the further course of
the game shows, is also in his favour, and, what is most important, Black
parts with his dark-squared bishop, which was very necessary to him both for
the defence of his king, and for counter-attack (the diagonal a7-g1).} ({At
the board I was afraid of the positional move} 17... Ndf6 {, which in effect
completes his development.} 18. -- ({My opponent did not like the fact that
after} 18. Ng5 {his queen has a number of unfriendly neighbours, but they
could have been driven away by the logical} h6 {.}) ({I was intending to
continue} 18. Nc5 {, but after the logical} Nd5 $1 {Black's chances are at any
rate not worse.})) 18. gxh4 {(1.30)} Qxh4 {(2.20)} (18... Qf5 {was more
stubborn, but Black decided to 'suffer for his cause'.}) 19. h3 {(1.30)} Ngf6 {

at last, to develop his queenside pieces.}) 20... Nb6 {(2.24)} 21. e4 {(1.35)}
Be6 {(2.25)} 22. Bc3 {(1.38)} Nfd7 {(2.26) --- White's attack on the kingside
is gradually accelerating. Its leader is the bishop on c3, which does not have
an opposite number. In such a position there is no need to hurry unduly.} 23.
Rad1 {(1.50) --- At any rate keeping the knight at d7 under fire. White
provokes ...Rad8, which in certain variations leaves Black's a-pawn undefended.
We will see within a few moves why this is necessary.} Rad8 {(2.27)} ({Better
chances were offered by} 23... Bc4 {in the hope of} 24. Be1 Qh6 25. Rxd7 $2
Bxf1 {.}) ({I was intending after} 23... Bc4 24. Be1 Qh6 {, to play simply} 25.
Rf2 {, keeping in reserve the threat of Rxd7, and then once again driving away
Black's pieces by b3. It would not be out of place to mention that at this
point Zhuravlev was in severe time-trouble.}) 24. b3 $1 {(1.53)} Rfe8 {(2.28)}

very precarious.} ({After} 25. a4 {Black cannot play} f6 26. Be1 Qh6 27. Nxe6

possible, Black brings his queen back.}) 27... Qf8 {(2.29)} (27... Qf8 {tries
to gain time by the threat of 28...Qc5+, but now White's knight no longer
needs to be defended, which gives him a new and very attractive possibility.})

1. e4 c6 {Strange as it may seem, an unexpected reply, since the Hungarian
champion adopts this defence very rarely, and we (more precisely, I) had
somehow not thought up any plans against the Caro-Kann. It was clear that the
Hungarians would have carefully studied the games from my matches with
Botvinnik, and therefore, without any prepared 'mines', it would be
inexpedient to choose the variations with 7 h4 (2 d4 d5 3 Nc3 dxe4 4 Nxe4 Bf5
5 Ng3 Bg6 6 N1e2 Nf6) or 4 h4 (3 e5 Bf5). After Portisch's first move I
feverishly began to recall which variations I had not yet adopted in
tournaments. To my aid came reminiscences as a trainer. Last year in the USSR
Ladies' Championship I assisted Zara Nakhimovskaya, and since the Riga lady,
in answer to 1 e4, plays only l...c6, we studied the various systems of the
Caro-Kann literally for a whole day. As it happened, Konoplyeva chose the line
2 Nc3 d5 3 Nf3. From the opening Nakhimovskaya obtained an excellent position,
but all the time I felt that somewhere White could have played better 
(although, of course, I did not mention this to Zara). It was now that I
remembered this. In the end, I decided, Portisch has played less games with
the Caro-Kann than Nakhimovskaya (I hope that they will both excuse me for
this comparison).} 2. Nc3 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 {A slight, but rather well-known
inaccuracy.} (3... Bg4 {has long been considered best here, not yielding White
an inch in the centre. Who knows, perhaps Portisch did not like the variation}

Botvinnik.}) 4. Nxe4 Bg4 5. h3 Bxf3 6. Qxf3 Nd7 7. d4 Ngf6 8. Bd3 Nxe4 9. Qxe4

attacked, to be able to retreat it to e2. White, however, has something else
in mind.}) 10... Be7 {Portisch does not hurry to play ...Nf6.} 11. c3 Nf6 12.
Qh4 ({After} 12. Qe2 {White has a slight, but indisputable, positional
advantage. I wished to lure the knight onto d5 from where it is unable to take
up the good defensive post f8. However, this is achieved at the cost of
several tempi and Black has time to stabilise the position.}) 12... Nd5 13. Qg4

to keep the black king in the centre, but then I noticed that after} Ne7 $1 {
White's initiative would soon evaporate.}) ({Allowing Black to castle with} 14.

out a favourable regrouping of his pieces by} 15. Bh6 Re8 16. Rad1 Qb6 17. Bc1

is actively placed in the centre. Portisch prevents the development of White's
queenside.}) 14... Qb6 ({At this point after} 14... Qb6 {, 'correct' (one can
also write it without the inverted commas) was the reserved} 15. a3 {, with
the hope of exploiting the famous pair of bishops in a protracted struggle.
Before the match we had noticed that the Hungarian Grandmaster has an
excellent feel for the most subtle strategic nuances but reacts less
confidently to sudden tactical turns. This, and also the fact that the black
king has stood with impunity in the centre of the board for 14 moves, provoked
the following reaction.}) 15. c4 $5 {This looks like a blunder - after the
natural ...} Nb4 {... White's bishop and his central pawn are attacked.} ({On} 
15... Ne7 {I was planning} 16. d5 $1 cxd5 17. cxd5 Nxd5 18. Qa4+ {, at any
rate preventing Black from castling.}) 16. Rxe6+ {The only continuation to
justify his previous move.} fxe6 17. Qxe6+ {Here Black was faced with the
problem: how to punish the opponent for his recklessness.} ({It is clear that

anything better for White.}) ({My hopes were chiefly associated with the

to me and a continuation of the variation (not exactly forced, it is true)

seems that this should have been the normal outcome of the game.} 18. Bf4 Rd8 {

regains his material while keeping a very strong attack. By giving up his
queen Black can look confidently to the future.}) 19. c5 Nxd3 $1 20. cxb6 {

last by} 20. Bh6 {to which Black has one good reply} Qxb2 $1 ({less good is}

reach the square a7, so White decided on the risky, though not losing, capture
of the queen.}) 20... Nxf4 21. Qg4 Nd5 22. bxa7 {A position has arisen with a
rather unusual material balance. White has a queen and three pawns against a
rook and two minor pieces. If Black succeeds in coordinating his forces, then
he will clearly have the better chances. There are two factors which hinder
this: the audacious pawn on a7, which at the very least frightens Black, and,
although only temporary, the difficulty of developing his king's rook. With
his next move Portisch tries to solve these two problems simultaneously, but
the further course of the game shows that his plan is incorrect.} Ke7 ({The
idea of} 22... Ke7 {is clear, Black's king heads for the a-pawn, and any
checks will only act as a following wind, for example,} 23. Re1+ Kd6 24. Qg3+
Kd7 25. Qg4+ Kc7 {. It is clear that White must somehow open up lines on the
queenside, so that, in his new place also, the black king will feel
uncomfortable. This White succeeds in doing.}) ({Therefore, stronger was the
straightforward} 22... g6 {. How the game would have finished in this case, I
do not know, but at the board it seemed to me that the pawn on a7 insures
White, to a significant degree, against defeat. In a number of variations he
is able, by playing a8Q, to win in exchange both Black's remaining queenside
pawns.}) 23. b4 $1 {Evidently Portisch underestimated this reply. Since it is
clear that capturing the pawn is bad because of 24 Rb1, Black is forced to
allow it on further, and its advance spreads confusion in the enemy ranks.} Ra8
({Even so, stronger perhaps was} 23... Kd6 24. b5 Kc7 {, not giving up, for
the moment, the idea of going after the pawn. In any event there will be no
time to capture it.}) 24. Re1+ Kd6 25. b5 $1 Rxa7 $2 {This loses instantly,
but Black's defensive task was already very difficult.} ({After} 25... Rxa7 {

27. Qe6+ Kc7 28. Rc1) ({and the constricting} 26. b6 $1 {, after which either
the a-pawn remains a constant threat, or else Black must, all the same, go in
for the extremely dangerous opening of the b-file (after} Nxb6 27. Rb1 {). The
move in the game hastens the end.})) 26. Re6+ Kc7 27. Rxf6 $1 1-0

easily persuaded myself not to reject such a tempting, though not unhazardous,
idea. The amusing variation which I found at this moment (cf. the note to
Black's 18th move), reinforced the conviction that to refrain from such a
sacrifice would be simply shameful. All this time the after-taste of the
fourth game was somehow weighing on my mind, and I even used a sort of
internal monologue in order to make up my mind: 'If in the end, Misha, you are
destined to lose this match, there is no need for the reason to be cowardice'.}

the enemy king, and the standard combination with successive bishop sacrifices

{After an absence of more than a year from tournament play (this time had been
spent playing matches) it was 1966 when I set off for Sarajevo. I have already
said that I play with particular pleasure in Yugoslavia, and with success, and
the traditional Sarajevo Tournament was no exception. --- I do not recall what
it was that held me up, but I was somewhat delayed in leaving Moscow, and I
flew out to Yugoslavia in the same plane as our footballers. Petar Smederavac,
my son's godfather, was due to meet me at the airport (immediately after my
match with Larsen he had got married, and I had been a witness at the wedding),
but he was a few minutes late, and the Soviet footballers introduced me to
their Yugoslav colleagues as... the Soviet team masseur. Then Petar appeared,
took me away in another car, and the footballers were 'orphaned'.} 1. -- {
Right from the start in Sarajevo, I played several interesting games,
including one with Damjanovic, against whom I held a grudge. The point was
that, during the match with Spassky, Mata had also been playing in Tbilisi,
in an International Tournament, and in an interview had characterised me as
follows: 'Tal plays the opening like a good Grandmaster, the middle game
better than a good Grandmaster, and the endgame like an ordinary master'. Such
a formulation very much displeased me, and you will understand that it was
with great pleasure that I exchanged queens in our game, especially since the
resulting ending was clearly in my favour. --- This tournament also saw the
continuation of my duel with Spassky, this time, of course, by proxy. The
Czech master Jansa, who was both a friend and an admirer of Boris, chose
against me that same variation of the Ruy Lopez, in principle favourable for
White, which had nevertheless caused me so much trouble in the 9th game with
Spassky. In a very sharp position Jansa offered me a draw and in reply I
immediately blundered and lost. Then there was a very amusing episode in my
game with Matulovic, who completely fits the description of me given above by
Damjanovic. In a slightly favourable rook ending I occupied the only open file
with my rook, expecting Matulovic to do the same. Then, however, Black would
have been left with a very slightly better pawn ending, which would have been
quite impossible to win. The Yugoslav did not place his rook on the open file
either straight away, or at any time that it was possible. Thus the file
remained in my hands for ever, my advantage increased, and in the end I won.
To the question, why had he not exchanged rooks, Matulovic gave a quite
unexpected reply: 'I haven't yet studied pawn endings!'} *

then resign.} (25. -- {After ten rounds I was trailing the leader, the
Yugoslav player Ciric, by 1½ points! The future Grandmaster, usually so
peaceable, was thirsting for a fight in Sarajevo. He had scored eight wins,
one defeat, and only one draw! --- We met in the 11th round, and the previous
day I had read in a sports paper a somewhat flowery compliment addressed by
him to me. In an interview, Ciric had said that he thought he had good chances
of first place, and that if Spassky had been playing instead of Tal, he would
consider his victory already assured, whereas, as it was, everything was not
yet clear. --- I did my best to confirm his fears, and won our game. There was
an amusing finish to it. For this encounter, apart from the normal fans with a
good understanding of chess, many sports fans arrived. In the time-scramble,
with the demonstrators somewhat behind the players, Ciric obtained a second
queen on the 39th move, but resigned on the 40th, and shook my hand. On seeing
the handshake and the two black queens on the board, the less experienced
spectators shouted 'Bravo, Cira!', while at the same time the more qualified
section of the public was shouting 'Bravo, Tal!' They were all quietened by
the demonstrator who hung up on the board the sign 'White won'. --- Thus, when
the last round began, we found ourselves level, and that is how we finished.
--- Once again there came a break in my chess life. It was due to the fact
that, after a 3-year interval, my diseased kidney made itself felt, and also
that there took place in Moscow the match for the World Championship, at which
I once again fulfilled my duties as a journalist. In short, it was only in the
autumn that I once again sat down at the board. --- I began the Kislovodsk
Tournament with a defeat at the hands of the Moldavian master Lutikov, but
then my fortunes sharply improved until my kidney began playing up. For
several days, the question of my leaving the tournament was debated, but I
decided to play on to the end, thinking that there was no reason why the
talented Lutikov, similar to me in his chess convictions, should suffer
because of me. I dissipated the whole of my plus score, and finished only on
the 50% mark. --- It was therefore not without some apprehension that I began
my next tournament. All the time I was haunted by the thought: what if my
illness should make itself felt during the Team Championship of the Country
for Sports Societies. I could not avoid taking part: the tournament on the top
board would be extremely strong, and Botvinnik would be playing there. After
declining to play in the Candidates Matches the previous year, he was pretty
'hungry', and played with great enthusiasm.}) (25. -- {JOURNALIST. The joke
was made that, in this team tournament, all the World Championship Matches of
recent years were continued. --- CHESS PLAYER. Yes, on the top board the
following games took place: Botvinnik-Smyslov, Botvinnik-Tal,
Botvinnik-Petrosian, Petrosian-Spassky, as well as matches from the Candidates
Cycle: Spassky-Tal and Spassky-Keres. --- Prior to the last round I had
succeeded in winning just one game, though I had not suffered any defeats.
Then I faced the leader, Botvinnik. After it, the score in my games with
Mikhail Moiseyevich was finally levelled: after all, I had won the first match
against him by 4 points, but had lost the return by 5; in this game I first
won a theoretical duel, then a pawn, and in the adjourned position my material
advantage had risen three-fold. --- Besides our game, there were two other
games from the match unfinished, including one on a ladies' board in a very
complicated position. After glancing at the Tal-Botvinnik game, the team
trainer and I spent two whole nights analysing the ladies' adjourned position.
In the morning, we woke our lady player, quickly showed her the results of our
night-long analysis, and set off for the tournament hall. --- The adjourned
games were resumed. That evening the deciding match of the final round was due
to be held, in which Botvinnik would play Petrosian. Without any ulterior
motive, I went up to a representative of the 'Trud' team - Botvinnik's team -
and expressed my sincere admiration for the play of their constant leader.}) (
25. -- {The representative's reaction stunned me: 'Then agree a draw with
Botvinnik, and we will agree to a draw on the ladies' board, where we stand
better!' --- I was taken aback, and I didn't know what to reply. The
representative immediately went up to Botvinnik, who was thinking over his
move, and said something to him. The latter raised his head, waved the
representative away, and stopped his clock in a sign of resignation. In the
end Geller was the winner on the leaders' board, and we three - Botvinnik,
Petrosian and I - finished half a point behind. --- The end of the year was
crowded with events, but began in an unpleasant way. At the Olympiad in Havana
an unknown man 'caught' me with a 'tactical blow': a bottle to the head. As a
result, the 'first game' of the Olympiad, Tal-N.N., ended in my defeat, close
to a rout. --- However, this only led to my missing the first four rounds, in
which we played against Morocco and India, and in which I might have hoped to
improve my individual score. Perhaps this shock even had a beneficial effect
on me, just like the operation for appendicitis in 1959, for I played with
great enthusiasm. Despite missing the first four rounds, and the final one, I
nevertheless played more games than the other members of our team. As many as
three of the games played in Havana are given here, and of these the encounter
with Robert Byrne was of special significance. As is well known, the Soviet
team did not want to be given four points by default against the Americans,
who did not turn up to play*[Editor's note: The match had originally been
scheduled for a day on which Fischer could not play (for religious reasons),
and rather than play without their first board, the USA team did not appear
for the match.], and with our agreement the match was set for another day. It
was my game with Byrne that decided its fate. --- Before the last round, when
the success of our team was already assured, I was allowed by our captain to
fly out a little earlier than my colleagues: I was to be one of the first
Soviet players to participate in a tournament in Spain, in Palma de Mallorca.
--- I began, as if by inertia after Havana, in very lively style, and at the
start scored something like 5 out of 5. The Spaniard Arturo Pomar was also
playing well. Earlier I had read a lot about him, almost the only pupil of
Alekhine. I considered my most important game to be the one against Trifunovic,
the only player in the tournament with a plus score against me (see the
following game).}) 1-0

for me to first place.} (57. -- {JOURNALIST. But you, after all, also went
into the arena! Tell me, please; if in Havana the 'additional game' with N.N.
had occurred accidentally, why in Mallorca was it necessary to play a similar
'game' with a real live bull? --- CHESS PLAYER. Firstly, it was really more
like a calf. Secondly, I had heard so much about the bull-fight - from Bizet
to Hemingway - that it would be unthinkable to decline to take part in one in
such convenient circumstances. True, at that moment, I wasn't to know that the
following morning the local papers would display our photograph (that of the
calf and me) with the headline: 'The first Soviet bull-fighter in Spain!'
Three draws at the end of the tournament gave me first place. The year 1966
was over. --- The New Year found me in Tbilisi, once again in the role of
correspondent, at the USSR Championship. Since it was a Zonal Tournament, and
since I already had the right to play in the Candidates cycle, I considered
that it would be somewhat awkward for me to play, since to some extent I could
influence the distribution of the places, involuntarily fulfilling the role of
'controller'. --- In the spring my kidney once again began playing up, and I
went into the well-known Botkin hospital in Moscow. The observations turned
out to be so lengthy that from there, to put it bluntly, I did a bunk, since
there was the pleasant prospect of playing in a very strong International
Tournament in Moscow, dedicated to the 50th Anniversary of the Great October
Revolution. Starved of chess, I began fairly successfully, with wins over
Filip and Bilek (the combination in which was judged to be the most brilliant
in the tournament). Both these games are given here. Then, against Gligoric, I
got the order of moves wrong, and so did not win a piece, nor the game. For a
long time after this I was unsettled, not so much by the lost half point, as
by the missing of a simple tactical possibility. A draw with Gipslis followed,
then an incorrect sacrifice against Keres, simply refuted, and several more
draws. --- Only in the second half of the tournament did things go somewhat
better for me. The game that I won against Petrosian is given here; I defeated
the World Champion for the first time after a 10-year interval. I also gained
my first win against Bronstein for a long time, and defeated Uhlmann in an
amusing struggle. --- At one point the East German Grandmaster thought for so
long that my colleague Gipslis, who had already finished his game, went off to
hear The Barber of Seville, but was disappointed by the performance, and left
after the first act, and once again made for the tournament hall. To his
amazement, he found Uhlmann still thinking over the same move! His meditation
lasted for 1 hour 40 minutes! I would have laughed if at that time anyone had
said to me that in our next game Uhlmann would beat this record, but that's
just what happened: Uhlmann thought for 1 hour 50 minutes!! I suffered one
more defeat, playing the King's Indian Defence most unsuccessfully against
Portisch, and as a result shared 2nd-5th places with Smyslov, Bobotsov and
Gipslis. The winner was Leonid Stein. --- My next event, the Team Tournament
of the USSR Peoples' Spartakiad, was also in Moscow. Latvia found itself in a
strong preliminary group, from which we only reached the second final group. I
scored 6 points out of 9, without defeat, and played several interesting games.

{I have already said that with Yugoslav players I have the most warm and
friendly relations, but this does not prevent us from fighting desperately at
the chessboard. Now I played for the first time in the traditional
USSR-Yugoslavia Match, which has been held regularly since 1956. It was in
1967 that, for the only time, the match was made into a tournament of 12
players, 6 from each country. It is still with a smile that in the press I
read references such as 'in the game Tal-Gipslis from the USSR-Yugoslavia
Match, 1967 ...' --- In the first round I played Gligoric, adopting the same
variation as in the Moscow Tournament a few months earlier, the variation over
which such a discussion was to flare up between us in the Candidates Match a
year later. Then came a draw with Korchnoi, who set an exceptional pace, and
as a result outstripped his closest rivals - Gligoric and myself - by one and
a half points. --- Then, after a lengthy stay in hospital, this time in Riga,
I played two games with my old friend Victor Ciocaltea in the equally
traditional match between Latvia and Rumania. After this came the Championship
of the Soviet Union in Kharkov. It was the first and, God grant, the last
experiment of running the USSR Championship on the Swiss System. After all,
the overwhelming majority of the players who gathered in Kharkov (and there
were more than a hundred) played interesting chess, but were not serious
contenders for the gold medal. No arguments in favour of the system - the
greater number of participants, a school for the young, etc. - can hide its
main drawback: the influence of Lady Luck. I began with three wins. Then came
a slight setback of several draws, but one of them was judged to be the most
brilliant game of the Championship, and both players received a special prize.

{The first of the decisive games in the Championship proved to be the
encounter with Grandmaster Vasiukov, who played some interesting chess in
Kharkov. This game is given in the book. --- The second key moment in the
Championship was my game against Polugaevsky in the penultimate round. We were
leading with the same number of points, and when, after 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4, I
played 2...e6, Lev offered me a draw. I accepted, although for decency's sake
we made a further 12 moves or so, and the question of first place was put off
until the last round. --- By the luck of the draw, Polugaevsky, much to his
displeasure, had to play Grandmaster Kholmov, whom up till then he had never
beaten. My opponent was to be my compatriot Zhuravlev: a master from Liepay
who, as it happened, I had never played before. The piquancy of the situation
was increased by the fact that should Zhuravlev win, although he had never
qualified for even a USSR Championship semi-final, he would become a
Grandmaster of the Soviet Union! --- Polugaevsky was very upset by the result
of the draw, and I took great pleasure in teasing Lev, 'confidentially'
informing him that in Riga an urgent meeting of the Chess Federation was being
held in order to decide the question: did Latvia want a USSR Champion, or a
new Grandmaster. That evening I went into Polugaevsky's room, and informed him
that the Federation had decided the question in favour of the USSR Champion.
--- Of course, of this 'meeting' and 'decision' of the Latvian Chess
Federation, Zhuravlev knew nothing. --- The following day, having completely
pulled himself together, Polugaevsky scored a clear-cut win over Kholmov,

{The following year, 1968, brought me few laurels, and it all started in
January, at the traditional tournament in Wijk aan Zee. I played there with
Korchnoi, and the Leningrad player once again set a furious pace, scoring 6½ out of 7 at the start.
From my first games I felt that I had neither the
enthusiasm, nor the right sort of mood, for chess. --- From the whole
tournament there were only two games that I could boast about. The game
against Donner is given here in this book, and this is the other:} 24... Rca8

start of the Candidates matches, and showed that, to put it mildly, I was not
in my best form. This was also confirmed by the start of my match with
Gligoric. In preparing for this encounter, Koblents and I realised that a duel
was likely to develop in one or more topical opening schemes, since the
theoretical preparation of the Yugoslav Grandmaster has always been notable
for its thoroughness and soundness. --- There was no discussion about where
the match should be held: I readily agreed to play on my opponent's 'home
ground' in Belgrade.} 0-1

{In the first game I had the white pieces, and at the start I was
subconsciously unwilling to reveal my secret weapon immediately. On the other
hand, success would mean the immediate destruction of Gligoric's favourite and
main defence against 1 e4. The second consideration outweighed, and after
spending some three minutes on the opening, I made the preparatory move} 22.
Ra3 {(In the overcrowded hall of the Palace of Syndicates, where we were
playing, the noise level rose: whether it was a joke or not, the rook had
placed itself en prise to the black bishop. Gligoric sank into thought, and
after 40 minutes found the correct way to neutralise White's innovation.)} bxa4
23. Rxa4 Rab8 {. Subsequently I could have obtained an ending with an extra
pawn, but this would have been practically equivalent to agreeing a draw.
Preferring a sharp game, I avoided this, then at some point blundered, and in
the adjourned position Gligoric found a precise way to win. --- The second
game again featured a theoretical duel, this time in the Nimzo-Indian Defence
where we had prepared an improvement in Gligoric's favourite variation. As a
result, Gligoric immediately offered a draw as White, but I had to try to win
one back and began attempting to obtain more from the position than was
justified. Suddenly I saw for White an excellent combination (however,
analysis later showed it to be incorrect). To avoid it, I moved my knight away
from the centre, and nervously offered a draw myself, but the advantage was
now with Gligoric. Only in the time-scramble did I manage to win the exchange,
which, however, did not give any real winning chances. The following day, when
the game was to be resumed, there was an important international football
match in Belgrade, which was clearly not worth missing for the sake of such a
position. --- So, after agreeing to a draw, Gligoric and I went together
amicably to the match between Yugoslavia and France.} (23... -- {In the third
game another misfortune befell me, and rather an amusing one. In preparing for
the match, we knew that in reply to 1 d4 Gligoric played the King's Indian
Defence 90 times out of 100, and I decided to playa system often chosen by
Larsen. It was only when I played it that I immediately remembered that I had
already adopted the same variation as Black against lvkov at Bled, in 1961,
when Gligoric was present. The Yugoslav naturally neutralised my whole set-up,
and in a slightly superior position offered a draw. --- Only the fourth game
gave me a certain cause for optimism. I once again won the theoretical duel
in the Nimzo-Indian Defence, and this time, with the slightly better game, I
offered a draw 'from a position of strength'. For almost the first time in my
life, the sober voice of reason suggested that for the moment it was not worth
declining draws, but was better to get into form and attempt to decide the
match in the 3rd, 4th, and should the opportunity arise, 5th 'White' games.
--- But nothing came of the 5th game, and many of the reporters in the
Yugoslav press began to express their preference for Gligoric. They said that
he had a point in hand, that he had three 'White' games to come against my two,
and that he was fit and well prepared physically. However, I sensed that I was
'beginning to play', and felt that in the fifth game I had seen quite a lot at
the board. --- Gligoric, meanwhile, was in something of a dilemma. On the one
hand he realised that it would be good to increase his advantage with a win,
but on the other hand he began playing with an extra degree of caution, so as
to maintain that which had already been achieved. This indecision only
hindered him. At any rate, in the sixth game he played inconsistently, making
first a safe move, and then an active one. It is not impossible that Gligoric
was disturbed by my playing an opening which I had never played before. Be
that as it may, the score in the match was levelled, and besides, I had
noticed earlier that Gligoric before a defeat, and Gligoric after one are two
entirely different players. --- This was also confirmed in our match. In the
seventh game I held the initiative, and managed to take the lead, so that both
the score, and the mood of the opponents, had changed in my favour.}) (23... --
{Gligoric had two 'White' games remaining, and here my sense of danger came
into operation, though when it arose in me I do not know. In the eighth game I
decided to avoid repeating the variation with which I had twice been
successful. --- With what was I to replace it? I decided to 'borrow' from
Larsen, who at that time was playing his match with Portisch in Zagreb, 
(incidentally, late every evening we would watch on television both a
commentary on my game with Gligoric, and a description of the game between the
Dane and the Hungarian) and chose the variation which he was adopting in the
Nimzo-Indian Defence. --- The decision proved to be a correct one, since later
Gligoric told me that it was before the 8th game that he and Velimirovic had
found an important improvement, which effectively put out of business the
variation which I had played in the 2nd and 4th games. The fact that I myself
diverged noticeably distressed the Yugoslav Grandmaster. I quickly obtained at
least an equal game, but despite having the better prospects, offered a draw,
since I very much wanted to be in time to watch the televising of the football
match between the USSR and Hungary. Gligoric thought for some 25-30 minutes,
until midway through the first half, and declined. I felt just a little bit
angry, but even so, when within 5 or 6 moves Gligoric in turn offered a draw,
I did not try to gain revenge for the missed football: besides, I sensed that
Svetozar had already cracked.}) *

{Indeed, the following game, the 9th, turned out to be the last. In it I
adopted the move order chosen by Korchnoi in the 2nd game of his match with
Reshevsky, which was proceeding at the same time in Amsterdam. I did not, of
course, expect Gligoric to blunder away a pawn, as Reshevsky had done, but
this almost happened. --- True, at the last moment Gligoric realised the
danger, but he was able to ward it off only at the cost of two tempi. They
proved sufficient for the game to be adjourned in a position which, although
complicated, saw White the exchange ahead: A lively and highly significant
part in the analysis of the adjourned position was played by the world-famous
violinist David Oistrakh, an old and faithful lover of chess, who had arrived
in Yugoslavia for a concert. Incidentally, the analysis was quite complicated,
and we analysed the position roughly 18 moves ahead, avoiding a number of
false paths. It was the main variation of our analysis that occurred in the

{The resumption therefore proceeded at practically lightning speed. The match
concluded and I set off to visit Petar Smederavac, my son's godfather. Just on
my arrival in Yugoslavia, a daughter had been born to him, and I became her
godfather. Petar gave the baby the name of Talija. --- I returned to Moscow,
and exactly half an hour later Victor Korchnoi, who was to be my opponent in
the Candidates Semi-final Match, flew in from Amsterdam, where he had beaten
Reshevsky. --- In our match, the Leningrad Grandmaster was considered by chess
correspondents to be the undisputed favourite. The score of our previous
encounters appeared in the press, and it was recalled that, in the last
tournament where we had both participated (Wijk aan Zee), Korchnoi had
finished 3 points ahead of me. I was confronted by the following problems:
firstly, to make myself forget about our previous games, and secondly, to
force myself to playas reservedly as possible, since Korchnoi is at his most
dangerous in positions of a counter-attacking type, and feels less confident
in situations where he himself has to take the initiative. --- Therefore we
decided at the start of the match to give preference to 1 d4, since previously
I had always opened with my king's pawn against him. --- The very first game
fully confirmed all our expectations. I began extra-calmly, then came
simplification, and straight from the opening the game went into an ending
which I could not have lost if I had tried. Korchnoi could have gained
approximate equality, but he was completely discouraged by the way the game
had gone, and made two anti-positional moves. A pawn ending was reached which
was lost for him, although this still had to be proved. --- Here I wrongly
made the mistake of not believing myself. At first I wrote down the winning
move} 28. e5 {, but then decided to work out all the variations literally to
mate. To do this proved not at all easy. It was only several days later that a
detailed analysis appeared, confirming that, by avoiding many false paths,
White could win by force. Being unable to find all this at the board, I
rejected 28 e5, subsequently again played inaccurately, and Korchnoi found the
only moves to force a draw.} (28. -- {The most amusing thing is that I was not
at all upset: the game had shown that the match tactics we had planned were
quite correct. --- In the second game I again avoided all the sharp
continuations into which my opponent tried to provoke me, and in the third
game once again chose the quiet opening variation which had been
psychologically so unpleasant for Korchnoi in the first game. Here, and this
doesn't happen often, my opponent fell into a prepared opening trap, and I
obtained a completely won position with an extra pawn. I allowed myself to
relax a little, which you can't afford to do against Korchnoi, and first made
my task more complicated, and then in time-trouble lost all my advantage. ---
I realised that there was no cause for panic, and that this game would have
played on Korchnoi's nerves no less than on mine, but my heart began to be
tormented by doubts: one game I had not won, now a second. I was already
somewhat softened up when I arrived for the next game. --- Korchnoi very
keenly sensed this, played the first part of the game very energetically,
adopting an interesting theoretical innovation and obtained a clearly superior,
if not winning position. In addition, I was also dispirited by the fact that
over the first 15 moves I had spent a mass of time, and Korchnoi practically
none. --- To avoid the worst I decided to get some play at the cost of a pawn,
which, of course, Korchnoi should not have taken, but a recurrence of his old
illness - a tendency to capture pawns of 'any quality' - almost allowed me to
save the game. --- For the pawn Black's pieces came strongly into play, and
only severe time-trouble 'led' me past a continuation which would have made
Korchnoi fight for the draw. However, I blundered, lost a piece and the game.})
(28. -- {My good intentions were immediately abandoned, and after a lengthy
discussion with my second, I decided to return to my old ways, and play 1 e4,
although it had previously been unsuccessful against Korchnoi. In reply to
this, Korchnoi chose a quiet variation of the Ruy Lopez, which he had played
only rarely, promising White an active and superior game. I did not play the
best way, and Korchnoi practically equalised. Of course, if I had not been
burdened by the thought of my loss in the fourth game, and the chances missed
earlier, I would have gone in for the quiet position planned by Black, but my
nervous decision, taken on the spot, gave Korchnoi the chance to shine with a
typical counter-attack. --- Everything seemed to be settled. By tradition, the
match against Korchnoi was lost, for I would never make up the difference of
two points in the remaining five games, in three of which I would have Black,
and I went along quite calmly to the sixth game. Korchnoi evidently considered
even three draws to be a luxury for me, and went all out to 'finish me off'.
Indeed, he obtained the better position, while I was once again in
time-trouble, and took my only chance: to sacrifice the exchange for a pawn.
The position became considerably sharper, but Korchnoi was evidently
unprepared for such a change, and when the time control had been reached it
was clear that, despite being the exchange ahead, White was lost. --- The fate
of the match once more hung in the balance, and Korchnoi's self-confidence was
markedly shaken. In the last games of the match he tended,
uncharacteristically, to aim only for a draw. It became easier for me to play
in such a situation, but not once was I able to realise any advantage I gained.

{JOURNALIST. But how did you yourself react to Korchnoi's declaration? ---
CHESS PLAYER. I didn't. I knew Victor, and I knew that he was capable of
saying what he did not mean. However, I found it amusing how he expressed his
dissatisfaction, when a couple of months later I turned up as correspondent
for 64 at his Final Candidates Match with Spassky. Evidently he assumed that,
exploiting my official position, I would try to get even with him. --- Then I

{After the Championship I had once again to return to matches, and to meet
Bent Larsen, who had lost in the other Candidates semi-final Match. The winner
of our 'consolation' duel would have the right to compete in the next
Interzonal Tournament. --- At that point I felt so terrible that, for the
first time in my life, I appealed to the Soviet Chess Federation with a
request that the match be postponed. Our chess leaders reacted to this
suggestion extremely reservedly. It was in their interests that the match with
Larsen should be concluded before the start of the USSR Championship
semi-finals, since in the event of my losing, I would have to start the new
cycle for the crown in one of these semi-finals. Formally, I was assured that
everything possible would be done, but the leaders of our Federation were
'unable' to find Larsen, who at that time was playing a match with Westerinen
in Helsinki, and the match began on the date set previously. When I asked
Larsen whether he would have been prepared to postpone the match, he said
without thinking: 'Of course! My wife gave my telephone number in Helsinki to
your representative, but no one phoned me ...' --- This match with Larsen was
as bad as our first match had been interesting. --- Larsen is of the same
opinion, so this is by no means just the grumbling of the loser. Of all the
eight games, only the sixth, in which Bent played excellently, is worth
singling out. The remainder of the games abounded in mistakes, most of them by
me. My poor form in the match is best illustrated by the episode which
occurred in the 8th game. --- This position was reached after the black king
had 'taken a walk', and then returned to e8. I had calculated that by
advancing my a-pawn, I would win in a few moves, but suddenly I saw that by
castling (!!) Black could set up a counter-attack: on f2. I therefore began
taking energetic measures to prevent Black from castling... --- After the game,
which I lost, one of the participants in a mass tournament taking place there
came up to me, and asked why I hadn't played} 29. a5 {at the appropriate
moment. I replied, and then stopped short on seeing the glazed eyes of Larsen
and the enquiring fan. Only then did I realise that I had been fighting not
against castling, but against its shadow, and I thought to myself. 'It is just
as well that this was only a prestige game; if it had decided the match, I
would have been near to having a heart attack...' --- Then there came a
month's break in my chess biography, given over to medication. Lying in a Riga
hospital I appeared in the role of chess correspondent on the
Petrosian-Spassky match; I received the games move by move by telephone from
Moscow, and the following morning I dictated my notes on the games to the
Moscow stenographer of the chess weekly 64. I was then taken to Moscow, and
the day for the operation was named. Then I found out that for six to eight
weeks after it I would be confined to bed. Meanwhile the Championship of the
Soviet Union would have started, this year having the status of a Zonal
Tournament, and I decided to put off the operation until later. Nevertheless,
in my condition it proved quite impossible to play, and my colleagues tried
many times to persuade me to leave the tournament, but with my former optimism
I completed it all the same. Although in the lower half of the table most of
the time, in the middle of the tournament I somehow ran into form. I don't
know if it was that my opponents began to under-estimate me, or that my
organism suddenly became accustomed to working, but almost in successive games
I won against Lutikov, and inflicted the first defeat in the tournament on
Kholmov. In addition, Vasiukov lost on time in an equal position, and I began
to think: who knows, if I finish well, I may have chances yet. --- Then, five
rounds before the finish, I had two adjourned games; with a big advantage
against Stein, and an apparently completely won position against Furman. --- I
began to look ahead: for 'Zonal' success, besides these games, I would have to
win towards the end against Gipslis and Averkin. --- The adjourned games were
resumed. Furman found an interesting idea, sacrificed his queen, and we
reached a position where there was perhaps no longer a win. However, there was
very definitely no need for me to lose! I got into time-trouble, messed things
up, and resigned, and then with a complete lack of enthusiasm resumed my game
against Stein, finally drawing with difficulty. --- My overall score was quite
deplorable: for the first time since Curaçao I scored less than fifty per cent.

{The result of this game was of great significance. It was played two rounds
before the finish, when the Moscow Grandmaster was leading the tournament.
Among the chasing group, half a point behind, was his opponent. It should be
stated that, in a theoretical sense (and possibly also in a practical sense),
Vasiukov was prepared for the Championship better than anyone, and it would
appear that a great deal of credit for this must go to... Korchnoi. You may
recall that Vasiukov was Korchnoi's second at the Interzonal Tournament, and
in one of his interviews he wrote roughly the following: 'I hope that in some
way I was able to assist my 'ward'; as for myself, the creative contact with
Korchnoi afforded me great satisfaction, and has brought certain benefits'.

{'What do you think of the move 3...b5?' --- The Georgian Champion Bukhuti
Gurgenidze has for a long time shown himself to be one of the strongest
masters in the country. It should be mentioned that in his games, as a rule,
the creative element predominates over the practical. Whatever his results in
competitions, he plays a number of interesting games, and in practically every
tournament he tries out at times dubious, at times even paradoxical ideas,
which, however, he upholds with great success. Thus, for instance, against the
Sicilian Defence he adopts as White a most unusual set-up, which at first
provoked only sceptical smiles from his opponents and from theorists. But time
has passed, and it seems that not one of a number of strong opponents has
succeeded in demonstrating that the Georgian master's point of view is
unjustified. --- In the USSR Championship at Alma-Ata, Bukhuti Gurgenidze
adopted an unusual system in the Caro-Kann Defence. It might appear that this
opening has been studied so much in recent years that it is difficult to open
any new page in it. Nevertheless, this is not so; in a number of games in the
Championship, opening discoveries occurred as early as the third move.} 1. e4
c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 b5 {It should be said that the Georgian master adopted the
Caro-Kann Defence in this tournament from the very start. This was a rather
clever idea, because the opening had never previously been included in his
repertoire. Starting with the games in the third and fourth rounds against
Vasiukov and Liberzon, Gurgenidze played the Caro-Kann continually. In both of
the above-mentioned games the Panov attack occurred, and then at last Igor
Zaitsev played 3 Nc3. To the great astonishment of the spectators, the players,
and Gurgenidze's opponent, there followed this outwardly so paradoxical move 3.
..b5. --- Zaitsev, after thinking for quite a long time, played 4 e5 after
which the position became blocked. Zaitsev succeeded in obtaining an advantage,
but then, in analysis, it seems that Gurgenidze found an improvement for Black
(in particular, it is interesting that after 4 e5 he suggests 4...a5). --- On
the day before the game I was chatting with some Georgian masters, and they
half-jokingly asked me 'What do you think of the move 3...b5?' I answered
completely honestly: 'I think it's a horrible move.' When in the game I played
1 e4, I thought that Gurgenidze would believe me, but 3...b5 followed
nevertheless. After thinking for some 20 minutes over my fourth move, I came
to the conclusion that to refute this continuation immediately was not
possible.} 4. a3 ({I also considered} 4. Bd3 b4 5. Nce2 dxe4 6. Bxe4 Nf6 7. Bf3
{but after} g6 {a position is reached in which the advance of the b-pawn
proves its worth.}) 4... dxe4 {Now Black heads for one of the normal
variations.} 5. Nxe4 Bf5 ({This move is evidently not bad, but also possible
was} 5... Nf6 {as occurred in the game Klovans-Gurgenidze a few days later.
After} 6. Nxf6+ exf6 {Black tried to prevent the advance c4 and thus hold back
White's queenside pawn majority.}) ({Now, after} 5... Bf5 {, if White plays
the standard} 6. Ng3 Bg6 7. Nf3 Nd7 {then Black's ...b5 appears highly logical,
since it begins a struggle for the occupation of the central d5-square; when a
knight reaches there it will be no easy matter for White to drive it away by
advancing his d5-pawn. White decided to demonstrate that the advance of the
b-pawn has significantly weakened Black's position, and with a light heart
went in for the sacrifice of a pawn.}) 6. Bd3 Bxe4 ({I don't think that a
detailed analysis is necessary in order to demonstrate the advantages of
White's position after} 6... Qxd4 7. Nf3 Qd8 ({or} 7... Qd5) 8. Qe2 {.}) 7.
Bxe4 Nf6 {Here White once again thought for quite a long time.} (7... Nf6 8.
Bf3 {suggests itself, but after} e6 {it is not altogether clear how the pieces
should be developed. Black will play ...Bd6, ...Qc7, ...0-0 and then at some
point prepare the freeing advance ...e5. At the same time the pressure of
White's bishop along the long diagonal is not particularly effective, while
Black can always reply to a4 with ...b4, thus preventing the opening of lines
on the queenside.}) 8. Bd3 e6 ({But now} 8... Qxd4 {deserved attention:} 9. Nf3
Qd8 10. Qe2 e6 {. White has the initiative and a good position for the pawn,
but it can hardly be said that this is adequate compensation. I must admit the
truth: I made the move 8 Bd3 fairly calmly, since the Georgian master very
much dislikes positions in which, for a minimal material advantage, he has to
conduct a lengthy, painstaking, and relatively cheerless defence. That's the
way it was; after a short reflection Gurgenidze played ...e6. The fianchetto
of Black's bishop was also worth considering. In both cases White has a
certain advantage, but on the basis of this game one cannot, of course, speak
about a refutation of the Georgian master's original system.}) 9. Nf3 Be7 10.
Qe2 {For the moment White did not want to determine the position of his king,
having not lost hope of castling long, since the advance of Black's queenside
pawns appears fairly harmless. At the last minute he decided against this plan,
having decided that in a position with a certain advantage there is no point
in falling in with the opponent's intentions of complicating the game. It was
more accurate to castle straight away, and in answer to Black's castling play
Re1. It later becomes clear that 10 Qe2 loses a tempo.} Nbd7 {Black in turn
refrains from determining the position of his king.} ({In reply to} 10... Nbd7
11. Bd2 {he can play} Qc7 {, and on queenside castling by White, send his own
king over to the queenside. This variation can be continued:} 12. c4 bxc4 13.
Bxc4 Nb6 {, and with the d5-square in his hands Black can look to the future
with reasonable optimism.}) 11. O-O O-O 12. Re1 ({Here I wanted to play} 12.
Ne5 {immediately, but refrained from this move because of the continuation}
Nxe5 13. dxe5 Nd7 {, after which Black intends to exchange off White's active
bishop by ...Nc5.} 14. c3 {, will not do in view of} ({while in answer to} 14.
Rd1 {Black quietly plays} Qc7 {, once again threatening to take on e5}) 14...
Nxe5 {. --- Perhaps even in this case White's position is very slightly
preferable, but of course such simplification was not part of my plan.}) ({I
thought that Black's strongest move here was} 12. Re1 Qc7 {, so as on} 13. Ne5
{once again to play} Nxe5 14. dxe5 Nd7 {, but in this case White has time to
play c3, and on ...Nc5 simply retreats his light-squared bishop. ---
Gurgenidze's 12th move is basically prophylactic in its aims: Black defends
the e6- and f7-squares against possible future sacrifices, and vacates the
f8-square for one of his minor pieces.}) 12... Re8 {Black evidently plans to
play ...Nf8. White prevents this.} 13. Ne5 Nxe5 ({In view of the threat to his
c-pawn this exchange is evidently forced, because on} 13... Qc7 {Black has to
reckon with the sacrifice of the knight on f7, while} 14. Bf4 {also looks
quite strong.}) 14. dxe5 Nd5 (14... Nd7 {would be a mistake, since White has
the strong continuation} 15. Qe4 {winning the c-pawn. After the text, White
again spent a long time thinking, since it was difficult to find the correct
plan of attack. Black's main trump is the impregnable position of his knight
on d5. This is the logical consequence of the idea initiated by his third move.
If White does not succeed in creating any real threats on the kingside, Black
will consolidate his knight's post by ...a5 and ...a4, with a completely
secure position. However, White has no way of starting a direct attack: on 15
Qe4 Black replies simply} g6 {and on} 16. Bh6 {he can play} Bg5 {, while if
the h-pawn advances then Black can straight away capture it.}) 15. Qg4 {With a
threat to which Black does not pay sufficient attention.} ({Here Black should
have played} 15. Qg4 g6 {, after which} 16. h4 {is a pawn sacrifice whose
consequences are not altogether clear.} ({In answer to 15...g6, Gurgenidze was
afraid of} 16. b3 {, after which White drives away the black knight after all.
However, then} a5 {, with the positional threat of ...a4, looks quite good,
since on} 17. c4 {there follows} Nc3 {, and the somewhat exotic position of
the knight, which seriously hinders the activity of the white pieces, cannot
be exploited by White.})) 15... a5 {Gurgenidze played this consistent move...
--- ...but this move turns out to be very bad, since with a similar flank
diversion (but this time aimed against the king) White obtains a marked
advantage.} 16. h4 $1 {White's plan is relatively simple: he intends to play
h5, and then either Bh6 or h6, forcing a weakening of Black's kingside. Black
therefore cannot continue his plan, but must accept the sacrifice.} Bxh4 {Now
play becomes forced to a considerable extent, and a position for which both
players are striving is reached.} 17. g3 Be7 18. Kg2 g6 ({White's task would
perhaps be more difficult after the immediate} 18... Bf8 {so as to keep in
reserve the defensive resource ...f5.} 19. -- ({. Then there would be no point
in White playing} 19. Bg5 {since Black replies} f5 {and succeeds in
entrenching himself.}) ({. However, after 18...Bf8 White would still keep a
dangerous initiative by continuing} 19. Rh1 f5 (19... g6 {leads to the
position in the game}) 20. Qh5 $1 h6 21. Qg6 {and the threat of Rxh6 is very
difficult to meet. The move chosen by Gurgenidze leads to even more unpleasant
consequences for Black.})) 19. Rh1 {The threat is relatively transparent:
White intends to sacrifice his rook on h7, check with his queen on h5, and
then sacrifice another piece on g6, after which his attack is clearly
irresistible.} ({This same move (20 Rxh7) would be the answer to} 19. Rh1 Qc7 {

{It was now that I realised that in my present state it was impossible for me
to continue living and playing chess. I travelled to Tbilisi, and there they
removed my diseased kidney, which evidently should have been done 2-3 years
earlier. If it is possible to talk at all about renaissance, that was how I
felt when I came round after the operation. On roughly the fifth day, I was
already impatiently awaiting my next tournament. --- It was just at this time
that a rumour began to spread, to the effect that during the operation I had
suffered a complete and final 'defeat'. It reached Yugoslavia, and my friends
from the Moscow 'Mossovyet' Theatre, who were on tour there at that time, were
saddened to read in a number of Yugoslav newspapers of the death of Tal. I
hastened to reassure my friends, quoting them the words of one of the classic
humourists: 'The rumours about my death are greatly exaggerated!'} 1. -- {The
tournament about which I had been dreaming began in Tbilisi roughly a month

{I felt fine, but the doctors nevertheless advised me not to change climate
straight away, but to spend some time in Tbilisi under their observation. At
this time agreement had been reached about the 'Match of the Century', in
which, despite my recent results, I was allotted a fairly high board. Before
the meeting in Belgrade I also found time to take part in the Georgian
Championship, though I had to play hurriedly, sometimes at the rate of two
games per day. I set off to Moscow to prepare for the 'Match of the Century',
not even knowing how the Championship had ended, and only from the weekly 64
did I find out that I had taken first place. It was time for the chess
festival, the 'Match of the Century'. --- Brilliant organisation, the best
players in the world, and a hard struggle. I, for example, was expecting from
force of habit to get the better of Najdorf, since formerly I had always won
as White, whereas when he was White he usually aimed for a draw from the start.
--- On this occasion Najdorf maintained the equilibrium as Black in the first
game. In the second game he offered me a draw in a position where he had
compensation for a pawn minus. In reply I began to play more sharply, and came
under a mating attack. --- The third game is given here, and then in the
fourth round the USSR team played very cautiously, since the day before we had
lost the greater part of our lead. I was no exception. When I was faced by a
decision: to attempt to seize the initiative by an exchange sacrifice, or to
play quietly, I chose the second path, and soon offered a draw. Najdorf said
that he would consider it, then twice during his 45 minutes' thought consulted
with the captain of the Rest of the World team, Dr Euwe, and finally stretched
out his hand to me, adding: 'But the position is completely won for White!'
The 'dessert' after the 'Match of the Century' was the unofficial World
Lightning Championship. Interest was intensified by the fact that, for
apparently the first time, Fischer was taking part in an international
lightning tournament. Prior to this, Soviet players had often played
five-minute games with him, and on the basis of this previous experience he
was not considered one of the main contenders for first place. --- In the
first round, by tradition, I lost to him from a superior ending, and in the
second was technically punished by Robert for attempting to win one back. He
played excellently throughout the tournament, and ended up the winner, but I
played unevenly, losing several strange games. My wins against Reshevsky and
Korchnoi are worth mentioning.} 17. g4 dxe5 18. fxe5 Nxe5 19. Nxe5 Rxe5 20. Bd4

{Then I appeared for the Soviet team in the European Team Championship at
Kapfenberg. Clearly, if the USSR team had been able to defeat the Rest of the
World in the 'Match of the Century', on the same 10 boards the best teams of
Europe were beaten without much difficulty. One of my games, against Kolarov,
has found its way into this book. --- After this I took part in a completely
new, unusual event. In Dnepropetrovsk, the USSR Cup Competition was held on
the so-called Olympic system, in which the losers drop out. In chess this is
not normal, and in addition, the time limit used was unusual: 45 moves in 2
hours 15 minutes, then 20 moves in the next hour, and a further hour for the
remainder of the game. If the main match of four games ended in a draw, then
two more games were to be played at semi-blitz speed, 1 hour for the whole
game, and if the score was still level, so on at this rate until the first win.
--- The seven Grandmasters competing were exempted from the first round, and
went straight into the last 32. I played three matches, and I cannot say that
the draw was very kind to me. Each encounter was with a 'known' player,
although there were a number of less experienced masters, unfamiliar to me,
taking part at Dnepropetrovsk. One of the games from my first match, with the
very solid International Master Bagirov, is given here. Our match finished
ahead of schedule since after a draw in the first game I won the next two. The
fate of each of my next two matches was decided in the last game. First I
played against Grandmaster Gufeld. Over a long period he had only won once
against me, and in the majority of the other games had been unsuccessful,
although he had sometimes had good positions. This was repeated in the match,
and Gufeld reacted so strongly to this that he even appeared in print with
notes to three of the games. --- In the first game, I adjourned a pawn down in
a difficult position, but on resumption succeeded in complicating my
opponent's task, and we reached a queen ending, in which, as is well known,
one can give as many checks as one likes. After the second time control, in a
now equal position, Gufeld marked off on his scoresheet a further twenty moves,
and was most surprised when I reminded him that there would be no further
control, and that we had to play on until the fall of the first flag. He had
some ten minutes remaining, while I had about twice as much, but I refrained
from exploiting such an 'advantage'. --- The next two games were drawn, and
then in the fourth, my opponent's nerves did not hold out.} 19. Bxc5 $1 gxf5 $1

the better chances in the 'quick' games, but suddenly it seemed to me that my
opponent had played the opening too loosely as Black, and I decided to
'punish' him, and sacrificed a pawn. This led to a slightly better ending for
Black, in which Savon began to 'torment' me. I was unable to stand this
'torture', and so I did not go forward into the semi-final. --- The winner of
the Cup was the initiator of the event in this form, Grandmaster Bronstein.
--- Whether it was because I did not perform too well in this event or for
some other reason, I don't know, but after the USSR Cup I was forgotten, and
remembered only when the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League
decided to hold a very interesting Match-Tournament in Sochi, between seven
Grandmasters and seven very strong young masters. In the Grandmaster team
there were such highly-qualified examiners as Korchnoi and Stein, while the
majority of our young opponents have since become Grandmasters themselves. ---
Even so, the tournament did not have an official status, and perhaps it was
because of this that, after our game, Tukmakov said that in Sochi the 'old
Tal' was playing. Two games from this tournament are given here. --- I awaited
the USSR Championship in my home town of Riga with great impatience, but for
formal reasons I was not allowed in. Much as it pained me, I had to make do

As you can see, in the final position I am the exchange and a pawn down, but
it is my opponent who has to force the draw. The question of first place
remained open until the penultimate round. I lost recklessly to the master
Kyarner, while Stein defeated Keres in an important encounter, and finished
first, ahead of Keres and myself by half a point. --- Individual tournaments
always alternate with team events, and I was still 'fit' to play for the
'Daugava' team. Off we went to Rostov-on-Don, to the Championship of the
Country. At this time our team was experiencing a crisis, since many strong
players from Latvia had joined the Army Sports Club and accompanied us with
the certainty that we would finish in one of the bottom places and drop out of
the Premier League. But we were a happy group, and once again an old truth was
confirmed: in team events, a high Elo coefficient is only half (and the less
important half!) of a guarantee of success. --- I played pretty well, and
received the prize for the best result on board one, but some really severe
tests awaited me at the end of the year: first the USSR Championship in
Leningrad, and then the International Alekhine Memorial Tournament in Moscow.}
(42... -- {In Leningrad I could not rid myself of a strange sensation.
Everything was apparently going alright: at first three draws and then four
wins in a row, but somewhere inside me there was this feeling: 'There's
something missing'. Indeed, as White I then lost without a fight to
Sharnkovich - this was one of the most undistinguished games of my whole life.
--- Then fatigue gradually began to take over. After all, when thoughts do not
arise with their normal ease and confidence, one has to compensate for this by
'squeezing out' the points. In the second half of the Championship, I
adjourned almost every game, and on the days set aside for adjournments I had
to sit down at the board three times. --- I was a contender for first place
almost to the very end, but a defeat at the hands of Stein deprived me of my
chance of taking the title, while an amazing defence by the master K.
Grigorian, who received the prize for the best ending, allowed Smyslov to draw
level with me before the last round. By drawing this final game with each
other, we received silver medals, while the 'gold' and the title of
Grandmaster went to Savon. --- In this tournament I played for the first time
against Anatoly Karpov. On this occasion no real fight developed, but we more
than made up for this with a very tense struggle a month later in the Alekhine
Memorial. --- Eighteen Grandmasters took part in that event (only Balashov was
awaiting confirmation of his title). My play was highly uneven. It began in my
now traditional first round, when I gave the spectators a few happy moments by
declining a draw against Olafsson, and then, in far from Grandmaster style,
overlooking a standard mate in two moves on the back rank. --- Subsequently
there were further adventures, and some quite good games (one of them, against
Uhlmann, which received the prize for the most brilliant attack, is given in
the book; incidentally, it was here that Uhlmann established his record,
thinking over the move 12...exf5 for 1 hour 50 minutes), but I should like to
single out the game with Karpov. This young player had already twice performed
quite well in the Championship of our Country, finishing up each time around
5th place, but the veterans, among whom I include myself, did not rate his
chances very highly. On sitting down against him, I considered myself almost
obliged to win. --- A few inaccuracies, and Karpov found himself in
difficulties; then he overlooked a small tactical finesse, and came out a pawn
down with an inferior position.}) (42... -- {At this point, having confirmed
for myself my sceptical assessment of Karpov's play, I considered the fate of
the game to be decided. --- But I only had to play not very accurately for
Anatoly to obtain immediate counterplay. The position became sharper, and then
an ending was reached in which I had two rooks against a queen. I recalled a
similar ending from my match with Korchnoi and decided that history would not
repeat itself, and that I would play cautiously and accurately, and head for
the adjournment. --- For some reason or other, I did not manage to analyse the
position thoroughly, and we decided that I should make a sufficient number of
moves to reach the second adjournment, since Karpov, in our opinion, could not
strengthen his position. --- Evidently Karpov also realised that his position
was objectively lost, and straight after the resumption he made a bold raid
with his king. It had to be refuted tactically, but for this I was unprepared.
When we adjourned the game for the second time the position was already drawn.
My final result in the tournament, a share of 6th-7th places with the then
World Champion Spassky, could hardly be considered a success for either of us.
--- The first quarter of 1972 was devoted to preparing the Latvian team for
the first ever All-Union Chess Olympiad, and competing in the Olympiad itself.
Included in these preparations was a friendly match for which we travelled to
Leningrad. --- Both of my games against Korchnoi ended in draws. Then we
played in Vilnius in the traditional tournament for the Baltic Capitals with
the inclusion of Minsk. Of the three games here, I drew two, lost the third to
the master Kapengut, and then we set off to Moscow for the Olympiad. --- Once
again we took part in the traditional semi-finals, and once again the draw
brought us up against the Byelorussian team - our regular opponents against
whom we are usually lucky.}) (42... -- {JOURNALIST. Just a moment! The class
of your play is significantly higher than that of your fellow team members.
What are your duties associated with this? --- CHESS PLAYER. The main one,
strange as it may seem, is not the individual 'extracting' of points: these
are equally valuable on the first board and on the tenth. The main duty is a
consultation with each player before each round (true, this does not apply to
Gipslis and Klovans when we appear for the Latvian team, and not 'Daugava'),
and, of course, the analysis of adjourned positions, difficult though it may
be to straight away produce a 'diagnosis' on each of 5-6 adjournments in the
same round. To return to the Olympiad, up to the last round of the semi-final
it was not clear who would go forward to the main final: our team, or the
Byelorussians. (The formidable Moscow team was already safely assured of one
place.) In the penultimate round we heavily defeated Byelorussia, and in the
last round - Kazakhstan (my game from this match with the master M. Mukhin is
given here), and we went forward into the final. --- There we finished in 'our
own' sixth place. I would have taken first place on board one if I had simply
not played in the last round, and instead had given up my place to a reserve.
However, our last round opponents were the Leningrad team, and I could not
avoid playing against Korchnoi: our chess 'relationship' was too well known to
everyone. So I played, the game ended in a draw, and the prize for the best
result amongst the leaders went to Keres. This especially pleased me, since he
was a founder of the Riga magazine Shakhmaty. --- After the Olympiad came
another interval of four months, and how difficult it is to keep in good form
without the necessary practice... --- This chess 'Lent' was broken by a small
tournament in Viljandi, one of those organised with such skill and love by
Estonian chess players. In this little resort there assembled three
Grandmasters, several masters, and the strongest Estonian players. It was here
- although of course I found this out only later - that I suffered my last
defeat in 1972. The tournament developed into a race between myself and the
Moscow master Dvoretsky, but when I lost to the master Uusi (the game was
adjourned in a drawn position, but on the way to the tournament hall I
suddenly ceased to want a draw, and on the second move I allowed my opponent
to force mate), Sharnkovich and Suetin immediately drew level with me. Really
enraged by such a stupid loss I defeated both of them, then scored my third
point in succession in the last round, but nevertheless finished half a point
behind Dvoretsky. --- And then - though I naturally had no suspicion of it at
the time - there began that long series of games without defeat, of which, to
my sincere amazement, so much was written in the press. --- Up till the last
minute, the composition of our Olympiad team was not fixed, and in the end,
when those who had definitely been included were making preparations, Savon
and I set off to an International Tournament in Sukhumi. This was considered
to be a final testing for us, and for this I personally was glad: I have
always preferred live participation in a tournament to theoretical preparation.
--- And so - Sukhumi. It was hot, with the temperature in the shade sometimes
reaching 35~/=C, and the Northerners amongst us suffered pretty badly from it.
Thus, for instance, Robert Hübner, with whom I became acquainted in Sukhumi,
got sunburnt and his skin began to peel.}) 1/2-1/2

{I began the tournament moderately, although I realised that it was bound to
develop into a race with Savon. As it turned out, my game with him was the
critical one. In the opening I fell into a variation prepared by Army players,
got into a difficult position, and only succeeded in gaining some sort of play
just before the time control. Even so, I had no real illusions about the
adjourned position, which is just what Savon thought, and evidently it was
this that allowed me to slip out. --- In the course of the resumption the
following episode occurred. We were playing with a clock of far from perfect
construction, and on which the flag fell at nowhere near the correct time. It
fell on Savon's clock just as he was making his last move before the time
control. I saw that by rights White had at least a minute left, and to demand
a loss on time in such circumstances seemed blasphemous to me. All these
thoughts occurred in a flash, and before the controller had time to record the
fall of the flag, I made a move and pressed my clock. The game subsequently
ended in a draw. Towards the end I managed to win almost every game, and thus
take first place, while for the following game I was awarded a special prize.}

{JOURNALIST. How do you react to injustices committed against you? --- CHESS
PLAYER. I don't care for them at all, to put it mildly. On a previous occasion
I became extremely nervy when, once again at the last minute, I was excluded
from the team for the Lugano Olympiad, but usually I grit my teeth and try to
laugh, though, it is true, the laugh comes out rather malevolently. --- Savon,
a very sensitive person, was so affected by the nervous strain, that in Skopje
the Soviet team was essentially a man short. --- We got through the
preliminary group calmly enough, if you don't take into account the tense
match with Cuba, which the Soviet team won only because the controller did not
record Korchnoi's loss on time against Garcia, while the Cuban (and perhaps
Korchnoi as well) did not notice it. In the final, our troubles started in the
very first round. In the match with our traditionally difficult opponents, the
Hungarian team, our top four players scored three draws and one loss (Bilek
won against Korchnoi). In the next three matches we won with great difficulty
by the minimum margin, but in each of them one of the Soviet players was
defeated. --- There had been Olympiads where the Soviet team had gone through
without losing a single game! (or, at most, one or two). But here Petrosian
lost in the match against West Germany, Savon against Holland, and Karpov
against Bulgaria. --- I had managed to win all my games, but it is the
resumption with Radulov that I recall. At that point we were by no means
winning the match (one draw, three adjournments), and were more concerned with
ensuring that we didn't lose. We split up into groups for analysis and my
consultant was Grandmaster Keres, our team's trainer. I have quite a large
number of chess memories, but that night of analysis with Keres is one of the
most pleasant. The work was calm, flowing, as it were, of its own accord;
every hour a cup of coffee was consumed... and I never even suspected that
such an apparently uninteresting ending (I was a pawn up, with rooks and
opposite-coloured bishops) could contain so many interesting and beautiful
ideas. Incidentally, the analysis proved to be highly productive, for when on
the following day the game was again adjourned, on the 72nd move, Keres and I
were perfectly familiar with the position: we had reached it in our analysis
the previous night. There was no need for a second resumption: Radulov
resigned without further play. --- Since the Bulgarian Grandmaster Tringov
forgot(!!) to put his scoresheet with the sealed move inside the envelope,
Korchnoi was awarded the point, and we won the match. --- Since the team saw
that I was playing well, I was also included for the next match.} 22... Nde5 $1

Gradually we began to steal up on the leading group, and after a victory over
Yugoslavia by 2½-1½, our chances of the gold medal became fairly serious.
But then unexpected setbacks in the matches with Czechoslovakia and Argentina 
(all eight games were drawn!) once again undermined our position. --- At the
same time, the young and ambitious Hungarian team, 'scenting' success, was
playing with great enthusiasm, and was close to a heavy win against the Dutch,
whereupon a sensation was possible: the permanent champions - the USSR team -
might not be able to catch their friends and rivals. --- But suddenly the hall
groaned; the Hungarian Forintos had blundered into a mate, and the chances of
the two leading teams became level. --- Prior to the last round, we were only
slightly ahead of the Hungarians, splendidly led by Portisch. We met for the
final discussion regarding the composition of our team. The leaders of our
Chess Federation phoned from Moscow, and advised, even demanded, that both Tal
and Karpov should definitely play. Unfortunately, we were playing on adjacent
boards - myself on board four, and Karpov as first reserve - and there was no
way in which we could both have the white pieces (which is what they were
hoping for). As a result I was given the black pieces in the final match with
Rumania. --- On arriving for the match, we looked at the teams in the equally
important match between Hungary and West Germany, and received a rude shock:
the Germans were appearing without their leader, Grandmaster Hubner, who had
won the prize for the best score on board one, and their number two,
Grandmaster Darga. Straight away we began to be nagged by doubts: 'Can it be
that the Germans are trying, after all, to organise a sensation?'. --- Only at
the closing of the Olympiad did we find out that Hubner did not want to risk
his assured first place on board one, while Darga did not play, so as to give
International Master Pfleger the chance to play against Portisch, and in the
event of success (as Black!), to become a Grandmaster. --- All this we found
out later, but during the match we saw that the German masters were playing
very conscientiously. The young Hungarians, on the other hand, were evidently
'burned out' before this decisive encounter, and the result was 2-2. --- Our
match was not as tense as might have been expected. Karpov and Korchnoi,
playing White, quickly obtained winning positions, while Petrosian and I drew
as Black. --- This is how our difficult victory at the Olympiad in Skopje was
achieved. On my board I took first place with a score of 12 wins and 4 draws.
After this I had to make a choice: whether to play in the USSR Zonal
Championship. I already had the right to play in the Interzonal Tournament,
but after the story of 1970 I felt obliged not to miss any Championship of the
Country in which I had the chance to play. Thus I set off for Baku, where I
was the lone 'Interzonaller', and so was hors concours as regards the three
places into the Interzonal. --- I started off extremely sluggishly with six
draws in a row and more than once my technique of realising an advantage
misfired embarrassingly. At one point I had so lost confidence in myself, that
the thought even entered my head: am I capable of winning even one game?
Perhaps it was with the object of psychotherapy that I sat down in the foyer
of the tournament hall to play lightning chess with local first category
players. Here I was successful, my peace of mind was restored, and this told
immediately on my results.} 0-1

{The Championship ended, and the 'Russian troika' of Grandmasters - Balashov,
Vasiukov and Tal - as the Dutch described us, arrived for the traditional
tournament at Wijk aan Zee. --- I once again began modestly. True, in the
first round I played and made the acquaintance of the young Yugoslav Albin
Planinc, as well as his colleague Ljubomir Ljubojevic, about whom I had heard
many good things, and many sceptical ones. I found out for myself the
unevenness of Planinc's play. To me he lost without much of a fight, but then
he crushed Donner and Najdorf in turn, literally within 20 moves. ---
Meanwhile, I had reduced my pace, but since the results among the leading
group were very even, some four rounds before the finish there were still
eight or nine contestants within an interval of one point. --- I was pinning
my hopes on the finish, but in the 12th round I noticed that my opponent, Hort,
had a shocking cold, and I decided not to torment him for long. I won my last
three games, the first as follows:} 14. c5 Qxd4 15. Re4 Bxf3 16. gxf3 Nh3+ 17.

Before the start of the last round, Balashov was level with me, and the
newspapers were already saying that the two Russians would draw, and thereby
assure themselves of a share of first place. However, we both played for a win,
and I alone was successful.} 1-0

{On the way home we stayed on for a short time in Holland, appearing before
chess fans, and then a few days after my return there began a tournament which
I consider to be one of my best during the last few years. It was the
traditional Tallinn Tournament, the third in number. --- Its popularity had
grown, and on this occasion the list of Soviet players was even more
impressive. For the first time Spassky and Polugaevsky were playing, as well
as Keres, Bronstein, Tal, and other well-known players. From my initial wins I
can pick out two examples of squeezes in more or less positional style.} 14...

{The Interzonal Tournament was approaching, but prior to it I took part in two
somewhat unusual events. --- The first, organised by the Central Committee of
the Communist Youth League, was a tournament of Pioneers' Palaces. I had last
played for my Palace in Riga exactly 15 years previously, and here I was, once
again amongst the lads. Each team was led by a former pupil, now Grandmaster:
Smyslov, Spassky, Petrosian, Karpov, Bronstein, myself... we gave
simultaneous displays with clocks against the lads from the other teams, and
then added together the points gained by each captain and his team. At the
same time there was a separate event for the team captains. --- Each morning I
would meet my lads, and talk to them about the day's 'examiner', and I
breathed for myself the air of chess youth. It was all splendid! --- In the
captain's competition I came first, and here is one of the games, against the
young Candidate Master Zaid.} 19. Bxf7+ $1 Kxf7 20. Qd5+ Kg6 ({If} 20... Kf8 {

Qa7 32. Nf5 Qf7 33. Qd6+ Be7 34. Qc6 Rd8 35. Qxa6 {. There was still some time
before the last 'intermediate' event, the Match-Tournament between the three
USSR teams, and I went into hospital for a minor operation. --- It was not at
all essential, and the doctors, as far as I understood, performed it 'just in
case'. It was all but four years since I had been in hospital. I had grown
unaccustomed to this 'pleasure', and the acclimatisation was not altogether
successful. When, straight after the operation, I arrived for the team match,
my unbeaten run came to an abrupt end. After first defeating Bronstein, I then
lost twice to Balashov. In these games he played better than I did, but I paid
little attention to this warning. After all, I had never made much of this
famous run, and when it came to an end I said jokingly: 'Fine! Now I can start
a new one ...' --- But the new run began, unfortunately, somewhat later, after
the Interzonal Tournament. It is difficult to decide exactly why it happened,
but at the start of the Interzonal I played extremely badly. I can reproach
myself only for the fact that I did not realise it immediately, although the
very first game should have warned me. I was satisfied with the result, a draw
as Black against Smejkal, but in the course of the game I missed a spectacular
but by no means difficult combination, which would have given me somewhat the
better chances. --- Then came two defeats at the hands of players who could by
no means be considered amongst the strongest: Torre and Estevez. I played
unevenly and got into time-trouble, where my poor form immediately showed
itself. Blunders followed one after another, and among the things I overlooked
was a mate! --- This poor start evidently affected my delicate kidney, and I
fell ill. After missing two rounds I resumed play, and went into the game
against Korchnoi with just one desire: to win. He guessed my state of mind,
and around move ten offered a draw. I impulsively declined, and then began
seeking an objective reason for doing so. I began a sort of clearly
'left-sided' plan, got into an inferior position, and after mistakes by both
sides in the time-scramble, adjourned the game in a difficult position.} (35.
-- {Next I lost to Hubner in a game where I stood better at one point, but
then adjourned several games with winning chances, and did not as yet lose my
optimism. --- I was nevertheless playing 'creakily', with difficulty, and this
led to my amassing 6(!!) adjourned games: a difficult position against
Korchnoi, and better positions, as I thought, against Kuzmin, Karpov and
Tukmakov, as well as against Quinteros and Cuellar. If they were all to end up
as I was planning, then all would not yet be lost in the tournament. But the
resumption brought a serious correction, since it was impossible to analyse
all the positions anything like thoroughly. We managed this only in the game
against Tukmakov, finding a win at around three in the morning, and merely
made a superficial acquaintance with the others. --- The resumption began with
the game against Korchnoi, where a loss was more or less planned. Then came
Kuzmin, and I suddenly saw that in my nocturnal analysis (at about 5 a.m.) I
had made two moves in a row for myself(!!) which, of course, one could not
count on doing in an official situation. I should have agreed a draw, but I
thought for about forty minutes, and then, just at the point when I was ready
to conclude peace, Kotov, the chief controller came up and informed me that
Tukmakov had resigned without playing on. The thought flashed through my mind
that if I were to draw with Kuzmin now, I would then have to play on against
Karpov, and my adjournment analysis had not gone as far as that position. ---
So I decided to continue, and played on... to a hopeless position. ---
Following this, my results had no significance for me. Even a successful
second half of the tournament, with 6½ out of 9, the games played against
Larsen and Gligoric during this time are given here) only enabled me to finish
high enough to take the last prize. --- Strange as it may seem, I was grieved
by the fact that my best game, which was awarded a special prize, should have
been against Larsen, with whom I sympathised, and who I very much wanted to
see amongst the winners.}) 1-0

the board, while the clock is ticking. --- In the 37th USSR Championship,
White, as a rule, gained good positions using a rather old-fashioned system

years has gained a new lease of life. Although in theoretical reviews it is

1. c4 {A little bit of sharp practice. In the previous game between us with
the same colours, the Caro-Kann Defence occurred. --- This time also White has
nothing against repeating the Panov Attack, but with his first move rules out
the possibility of Bagirov playing the Alekhine Defence, on the theory of
which the Baku player works a great deal. --- Besides the Caro-Kann, the Slav
Defence is also in the Baku master's opening repertoire, so his reply was easy
to foresee.} c6 2. e4 {After the match Bagirov admitted that my second move
had been a surprise to him, since he had not planned to play the Caro-Kann
Defence (by transposition of moves the Panov Attack is reached).} d5 3. exd5

Nxd4 {. After lengthy reflection Polugaevsky rejected the tempting and very
strong move} 8. Nf3 {, but now this move could be expected, if only because
after the game all the participants in the championship found out about it.})

in no way stronger than the approved 10 Re1 but it does have one advantage,
that of novelty. Bagirov proves to be less prepared for it.} ({This same

occasion I played} 10. Re1 {, and after} Bf6 11. Be4 Nce7 {Black obtained a
reasonable position, although all through the game he had to overcome certain
difficulties.}) 10... Nxc3 {This is certainly playable.} ({Also possible is} 
10... Nf6 {, transposing into a line of the Queen's Gambit.}) 11. bxc3 Bf6 12.
Qe2 {On this move I spent a considerable time as it was essential to decide
what plan to adopt. In place of the isolated d-pawn, an isolated pawn couple
has appeared. One of the possible plans here is the advance of the central
pawns. This can be done as follows: Bb2, Qe2, rooks on d1 and possibly c1, the
bishop moves away from d3, and then, if feasible, c4 and d5. However, Black
also has time to develop his forces:... b6, ...Bb7, ...Na5, controlling the
d5-square, and possibly organising counterplay along the c-file. Therefore
White makes the noncommittal move 12 Qe2 which is useful for the harmonious
development of the heavy artillery, and also for active operations on the
kingside.} ({In passing, White sets a little trap: if Black tries to free
himself by} 12. Qe2 e5 {White is not limited to the win of a pawn by} 13. dxe5

} 12... b6 {fails to} 13. Qe4 {.}) ({However, the quiet} 12... g6 {was worth
considering.}) 13. Rb1 b6 {The fact that this advance of the b-pawn has been
provoked must be considered useful for White, since he insures himself against
a possible counter-attack by Black involving the move ...Qa5 (the c3-pawn is
attacked, and in some cases the queen can be transferred to the kingside).} 14.
Re1 ({In this position White thought for some time over the consequences of} 
14. h4 {. But what I didn't like was} Ne7 {(capturing on h4 naturally fails to
15 Qe4) with the possible variation} 15. Ng5 Nf5 $1 {. Now} 16. g4 {is too
dangerous in view of} Nxh4 17. Nxh7 Bc6 {when it is Black who has a very
strong attack.}) ({After the text-move, it is by no means easy for Black to
solve the problem of how to develop his pieces. On} 14. Re1 Ne7 {,} 15. Ne5 {
, transposing into positional lines, is possible (Bd2, Rbd1 etc.).}) 14... Re8
({On} 14... e5 $5 {White, if he wants to fight for the initiative, is bound to
capture the pawn:} 15. dxe5 Nxe5 16. Nxe5 Bxe5 17. Bxh7+ ({not} 17. Qxe5 Re8)
17... Kxh7 18. Qh5+ {and 19 Rxe5. However, it is a long way to a draw in this
position, since the heavy pieces are still present, while the black king's
shelter leaves much to be desired. Bagirov wishes to carry out the freeing
pawn advance under more favourable circumstances, but now some rather amusing
complications arise almost by force.}) 15. h4 {Once again, of course,
capturing the h-pawn is out of the question because of 16 Qe4. White plans to
continue Ng5 with an attack. Here 15...Ne7 appears less attractive because of
16 Ne5, and the weakening of f7 tells: the thematic combination Bxh7+ etc is
threatened. --- However, the move 15 h4 appears to be very double-edged, and
therefore Black's traditional decision - to answer a flank diversion with a
counterblow in the centre - is perfectly natural.} e5 {This was the
continuation to which White devoted most attention. Now he has to act very
energetically, otherwise Black will seize the initiative and his
counter-attack can develop very quickly.} 16. Ng5 exd4 {Consistent and quite
good, although to a certain extent forced.} ({In answer to} 16... h6 {,} 17.

a number of active possibilities. However, White's threats on the kingside
outweigh this circumstance.} ({Thus, on} 18. Be4 Bf5 {there would follow} 19.
Qh5 g6 20. Qh7 {, and if} Bg7 21. h5 $1 Bxe4 22. h6 {(this motif is repeated

19. Bxg5 f6 20. Qh5 {If White wishes to fight for an advantage, he must
continue to play aggressively.} ({On} 20. Bf4 {,} Bf5 {, forcing favourable
simplification, now appears satisfactory.}) 20... Rxe4 {This capture is
essential.} ({After} 20... fxg5 {White could reply} 21. hxg5 {with many
threats.}) 21. Rxe4 Kg8 {What a pity! After this feeble king move Black is
simply the exchange down without any compensation. The remaining part of the

the points situation was relatively unimportant. The result of each game did

games from the Kislovodsk Tournament. Perhaps there was a trap in store for me

that in the previous Championship of the country it was Shamkovich who
inflicted on the tournament leader Tal his first defeat in the 8th round was,
perhaps, one of the inspiring stimuli for the Riga player before the start of
the game given below. For 'invigoration' this game was once again played
through before the start of the 16th round here in Baku. There were some very
clear analogies. In both cases Shamkovich had Black. Prior to this game Tal
was again undefeated. Also, arithmetically the number 16 in some way resembles
8. In order that the similarity should be complete, it was decided to begin

opening tastes.}) ({Regarding the move made by White, it was known to the Riga

indeed, two years ago here in Tallinn, he defeated L. Stein in this variation.
Looking through some chess magazines literally half an hour before the start
of the game, I came across the game Westerinen-Kaplan, Skopje 1972, which
White had lost in 20 moves, and without checking any further I decided to
follow the Puerto-Rican.} Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bb2 Be7 6. c4 Nc7 ({Of course, the

continued 10 Qg4?, and after 10...Ne8 Black quickly seized the initiative, as
within two moves (11...d6 and 12...e5) the activity of the bishop on b2 was
curtailed. Of course, it was extremely naive to expect that the Finnish master
would repeat the game to the end.} 10. d4 {It turns out that White has a
certain advantage on his side.} cxd4 ({On} 10... d6 {there could follow} 11.

dangerous for Black was} 12. Ke2 {. The difference becomes noticeable
immediately.}) 12... d6 $1 {It is surprising, but apparently this simple move
escaped Westerinen 's attention.} 13. Nd3 ({It turns out that after} 13. Nc6 e5

1. c4 g6 2. Nc3 Bg7 3. Nf3 c5 {Since White, by avoiding the advance of his
d-pawn, has not insisted on the King's Indian Defence, the game now goes into
one of the popular systems of the English Opening. The theoretical opinion,
that Black obtains a comfortable position, has been confirmed on numerous
occasions. The one drawback to the system was disclosed by Taimanov in my game
with him a few rounds earlier. If White wants to draw, then he can. But
against a player like Larsen, one doesn't have to worry about such 'aggressive
peacefulness'.} 4. g3 Nc6 5. Bg2 e6 6. O-O Nge7 7. d3 {The supposition is
proved correct; the Danish grandmaster avoids a symmetrical pawn set-up in the
centre.} O-O 8. Bd2 d5 9. Qc1 {As the Petrosian-Fischer game from the 'Match
of the Century' showed, immediate operations on the queenside similarly do not
promise White a great deal. Larsen aims to exchange off the dark-squared
bishops, but while he is doing this Black has time to become fully mobilised.}

my opponent falls. The initial idea was simple - to guard the g5-square, and
to emphasise the futility of White's play on the kingside.} 15. Ne5 {With this
move Larsen was intending to start a most interesting combination, but then he

{A little later, during the Premier League of the USSR Championship, I was
reproached for the fact that fatigue after the tournament in Sochi was telling
on my play. This is hardly justified. Of course, the consequence of my failure
in the Interzonal was still having its effect, but even so I played better in
the Championship in Moscow than I had in Sochi. It was more likely that I was
affected by the cold that I caught at the very start of the event, which led
to my games from the second and third rounds being postponed. By the way, for
my relatively quick recovery, I am completely indebted to my wife, who was
partially filling the role of my second. --- Let us return to the Championship.
I recall my game with Polugaevsky, which was an exact reflection of the fourth
game of my match with Larsen. After correctly sacrificing a pawn, I thought
for 50 minutes over a tempting piece sacrifice, each minute becoming more and
more convinced that it would not work. When everything was quite clear, I
suddenly became angry with myself for wasting such a lot of time and...
sacrificed! With a few moves, which I had foreseen quite clearly, Polugaevsky
repulsed the attack, and it was all over. --- My subsequent play was rather
nervy. There were wins, while good opportunities were lost, but it was the
following game that was the last straw.} 12. Nxf7 $1 Kxf7 13. Bxe6+ Kf8 14. O-O

{Before the new year began I first played six games in a Match-Tournament
between the Russian Federation and Latvian teams, and then accepted with
pleasure an invitation to play in an International Tournament in Dubna, a
small town near Moscow, and a scientific centre of world renown. The audience
there, consisting of physicists from various countries, was very congenial, as
was the composition of the tournament. --- I was late for the first round, and
I entered the hall just as Kholmov was giving mate to Rukavina. It was at the
start when I succeeded in playing my most interesting games (of course, I
wasn't to know that it was in Dubna that my new run of unbeaten games was
beginning, about which less has been written, but which lasted longer than the
first). Here are some extracts from them:} 13... e4 $1 {A curious tactical

start (4½ out of 5) and the fact that the day after the finish of the Dubna
tournament I had to fly to the Christmas tournament in Hastings, the oldest in
the world, prescribed a quiet finish, which gave Grandmaster Kholmov the
chance to catch me.} (12. -- {JOURNALIST. Incidentally, what general qualities
should a second have? --- CHESS PLAYER. In the first place, he should be
faithful to his protégé. He must know his protégé well, be able to tell his
condition 'from the side', and be able to suggest when is the right time to
play more reservedly, and when to give full rein to instinct. The second may
be a like-minded chess thinker, or a chess antipode, it is not of great
importance. On the other hand, it is most essential that he should not be
overawed by the prestige of his protégé. Of course, it is important that the
second should carefully follow current chess literature, since there is no
point in having to invent everything anew in the process of preparation. With
regard to whether or not the second is a theorist, this is not all that
important. --- I very much dislike 'seasonal' seconds: today he assists
grandmaster A, tomorrow grandmaster B against grandmaster A, etc. This is
unpleasant, and, I would say, not altogether honest. --- It was not without
certain adventures that Kuzmin and I reached Hastings, since we were forced by
the weather to wait for more than 24 hours at Moscow airport. We eventually
arrived only a few hours before the start of a round, not the first, but the
second! --- After such a flight we were unable to play at full strength, and
both our games were pretty quickly agreed drawn. In general, my play in
Hastings was affected by a depression which set in after my game with the
Cuban master G. Garcia. --- In this game the slight threat of an attack on my
opponent's king persuaded him to give up the exchange, just so as to go into
an ending. After a further few moves his position became hopeless, and I
thought to myself: 'How good that it has all worked out so quickly; I may be
in time to go to the cinema'. Especially since, due to our late arrival,
Kuzmin and I had to play eight games on successive days, and we were glad of
every rest hour we could find. --- Then suddenly, having relaxed, I made a bad
blunder, and the game continued for the full five hours, and ended in a draw.
--- This affected my play, as did another unexpected consequence of our late
arrival. --- When we arrived, all the decent rooms in the hotel had been taken,
and we were accommodated somewhere in the attic in a completely unheated room.
Both of us - first I, then Kuzmin - caught a cold and fell ill. Even my wife
could tell this from my voice when she phoned me on New Year's Eve. I told her
that it was cold in our room, and the reaction was unexpected. Without saying
a word about it to me she phoned Moscow and asked our Chess Federation to help
me, to which the head of the Federation jokingly advised her to send to
Hastings some firewood or coal. --- Whatever the cause, my depression or the
'energy crisis', in the first eight rounds I scored only one win and seven
draws, and was going steadily along in 7th-8th place. Then, by winning three
games in a row, I joined the leading group, and when Kuzmin, having caught
cold in turn, lost two games, the battle for first place intensified. --- Of
the games from this spurt, the ones against Stean and Hartston turned out
quite well, but it was the following ending that afforded me the most pleasure
(see the following game).}) 1-0

for first place. Kuzmin and Szabo quickly agreed a draw, Timman defeated
Suttles, reached the Grandmaster norm and caught up with them, while after the
adjournment I also agreed a draw with the young Englishman Miles, and thus
became one of the four joint winners. --- I do not want to return to this
theme once again, but I spent the first half of 1974 in 'hibernation'; I
played only two games in a friendly match between the Sports Societies
'Daugava' and 'Avantgarde' - I think you will agree that this is too meagre a
ration for a player who very much loves playing. True, in one of these games I
tried out an idea which was to bring me three points in 1974. --- By contrast,
the remainder of the year was not just crowded, but overloaded with events.
--- In May there came preparations for the Olympiad in Nice, and once again we
had seven grandmasters contending for the six places in the team. On this
occasion my inclusion was not in doubt, and the 'superfluous seventh' turned
out to be Lev Polugaevsky, a recent Candidate. --- In Nice, Kuzmin, who had
also been mainly inactive from January to June, and I played in most of the
games in the preliminary group, in order to 'warm up'. This was very necessary,
since in my first few games I made some very amusing mistakes, which in one
case led to a draw with an opponent whose class of play was not all that high.
--- I felt that I was running into form only after the game given here with
Miagmasuren. After I had sacrificed a rook the spectators gathered round, and
this was immediately noticed by the leader of our delegation, V. D. Baturinsky,
who had just come into the hall. Being short in stature, he was unable to see
over the heads of the others, but when I stood up from the table, I
confidentially informed him that I was a rook down. --- 'Blundered?' our chief
asked indignantly, clearly ready to remind me of the instructions given before
the game to play quietly and carefully. --- 'Sacrificed!' --- 'Well, only mind
you play carefully' (!) Baturinsky recapitulated somewhat perplexedly.} 0-1

{Two weeks after the Olympiad I set off with my wife to a tournament in Lublin.
For the first time I had a personal invitation to an event [Editor's note:
Invitations are usually controlled by the Soviet Chess Federation.] while the
tournament was partly holiday-like in character and not particularly strong.
There were only three Grandmasters: Lengyel, Damjanovic and myself. --- I was
on form. Here, for instance, is the finish of one game.} 32. Rxd6 $1 Rc1+ 33.

me the culminating moment of the tournament was a victory in one game, gained
by... my wife. I would not have bothered to mention this 'semi-incident', had
there not unexpectedly followed an 'epilogue'. --- My game with Adamski
developed in very tense fashion. My opponent very much wanted to draw, and
even asked me before the game not to 'torment' him, if we should reach an
equal ending. However, when he offered a draw after I had been thinking
seriously for 30 minutes, I was irritated, instantly declined it, and straight
away... left a pawn en prise. We concluded the game in a terrible
time-scramble, in which my opponent gave up recording the game round about
move 25, and I some five moves later. --- In the course of this rapid play I
could have forced a draw, but I overlooked this, and instead left a piece en
prise. Adamski made his move, and I saw that it was time to resign. All the
same I made one more move, and my opponent's flag fell, but there was a
controller standing by, and he said nothing, so I assumed that the 40 moves
must have been made. Holding out my hand in a sign of resignation, I suddenly
heard the voice of my wife, speaking in Latvian: 'Have you made up some new
rules or something? After all, he's lost on time!' I replied in Russian that
there was a controller for that, but she held up the fingers of both hands:
that was how my wife had been counting the moves. --- We reconstructed the
score, and it turned out that Black had indeed not managed to make his 40th
move. My opponent took my scoresheet, rewrote it, and showed that he had made... 42 moves. It turned out that Adamski had simply added a repetition of moves,
which was quite ridiculous: the controller confirmed that there had been no
repetition. --- Then a decision was made by a commission of appeal, which, on
the basis of the 'eye-witness evidence' of a whole series of participants,
confirmed the loss on time. --- Much was written about this, even in the pages
of the Polish non-chess press. Adamski complained a great deal, but the end of
this episode amused me. The game appeared in The Chess Player with notes by
Adamski, and the total number of moves 42, so I maintain the right to make an
equally bare-faced falsification of the truth, and am 'preparing' to have
published one of my wins from a simultaneous display as a game Tal-Adamski. In
the end, this will be just as much the 'truth'.} 1-0

{In order to conclude the tale of the Lublin Tournament, I should also say
that there was no real battle for first place, but my wife, unlike her husband,
is very jealous as regards the position of Tal in the FIDE rating list, and
after consultations with the chief controller and some calculations, she
revealed that in order to maintain my rating I required not just first place,
but 12½ points out of the 15 possible. When, partly giving in to her
insistence, I won in the 13th round, she guiltily informed me that she had
apparently made a mistake, and that 12 points would suffice. I 'promised' her
that I would lose one of my games, but all the same finished with two quick
draws. --- I hardly had time to return to Riga before I set off for the Team
Championship of the Soviet Union with the 'Daugava' team. We were one of the
outsiders, and everyone thought that we would be one of the teams to drop out
of the Premier League. Almost all our opponents had ratings much superior to
ours. --- Who could have guessed that, apart from the teams roughly equal to
us, 'Moldova' and 'Zenit', the other team to drop out of the Premier League
would be 'Lokomotiv', headed by Grandmasters such as Spassky, Polugaevsky and
Platonov? But that is what happened. We played concertedly and energetically
and I succeeded in defeating Petrosian with an attack, and had a nice little

{The result was that I took first place on the top board: among those also
left behind were Spassky, Smyslov, Geller... Within a few days I flew to East
Germany to a tournament in Halle. --- I was already in Berlin before I was
told that the second Soviet participant would be Grandmaster Savon, replacing
Kuzmin, who was unwell. This tournament went much more calmly for me than the
one in Lublin. I drew several games in the first few rounds, in a couple of
which I was the defending side, while my win over Liebert did not make me
particularly happy because it was so unconvincing. --- Then, in the fifth
round, I played a game which did not strengthen my tournament position, but -
and this is much more important - it significantly improved my frame of mind.
This was a game in which I introduced an innovation, according to my opponent 
(a specialist in the Scheveningen Variation) who had published an article on
the move 6 g4 not long before the tournament. Either the innovation was a
success, or else my opponent reacted incorrectly to it, but by move 15 White's
position appeared overwhelming. Then, although I was perfectly well aware that
it was an unnecessary move, and not the best, I sacrificed a bishop so as to
cheer myself up.} 17. Bxd5 ({A 'clean' continuation of the attack would be

. At the end of the tournament, this game was awarded a special prize by the
magazine Schach. --- Instead of an extra half point, I thus obtained an
excellent supply of optimism, and between the 6th and 13th rounds drew only
two games while winning six. These included an important win over Knaak, which
is given here. This led to me taking the lead, and two draws at the finish
were sufficient to give me first place. --- The tournament was the main, but
by no means the only event, in a chess festival dedicated to the Jubilee of
the German Democratic Republic. Thus I gave several simultaneous displays 
(alone, unfortunately; Savon had to hurry on to Odessa). I particularly recall
my last two appearances on a holiday in Berlin, where I succeeded in playing
the following game.} 1/2-1/2

{It was during these displays that I was informed that essentially I would not
be able to go home. Grandmaster Kholmov could not go to the tournament in Novi
Sad, and it turned out that no one except me could replace him at the last
minute. I would have declined to play in any other event - the surfeit of play
was beginning to tell to some extent - but Yugoslavia was a special case.
After spending just one day at home, I once again set out for the airport. ---
Even so, I arrived only in time for the start of the third round, having found
out on the way that my colleagues in the tournament, Grandmasters Forintos and
Radulov, had so far scored 0 out of 4! Going straight from the 'plane to the
tournament hall, I quickly shared with Radulov the first Grandmaster point.
--- On the following day, my excessively wild play against Kirov led to the
ending of my long unbeaten run, although for a greater part of the game my
opponent was not thinking in terms of more than a draw. Then came a draw in
one of the postponed games (the leaders in the meantime had set a furious pace
and were far ahead) and I began to wonder whether on this occasion my
favourable Yugoslav sky was covered by clouds. However, in the middle of the
tournament I managed to increase my pace, and I scored 5½ points out of 6 at
the finish, and I could assure myself of first place by winning my adjourned
game from the last round against Buljovcic. --- At first glance it appeared
that the adjourned position was a dead draw, but even before the adjournment I
had seen a curious manoeuvre which led by force to a won queen ending. But I
was unable to actually play it. Buljovcic lives some 30 miles from Novi Sad,
and when I arrived for the resumption, instead of my opponent, there was a
telegram awaiting me. Buljovcic apologised, and said that because of a
motoring accident, in which, fortunately, only the car had suffered, he would
be unable to come. I suggested that the position be adjudicated, and the
variation which I demonstrated appeared convincing enough to my main rival in
the battle for first place, Grandmaster Forintos.}) (20. -- {After the
tournament I spent some two more weeks in Yugoslavia. First I gave some
displays, and then came the traditional match between Soviet and Yugoslav
players, played on the Scheveningen System [Editor's note: Every member of
each team plays against every member of the opposing team.] with six players
to each team. This is usually a match between the two countries, but at first
it was decided to call it Moscow-Belgrade. Since there were only two
Muscovites in our team, we appropriated an incomprehensible name: Combined
Team of USSR Clubs. We could not simply call ourselves the USSR Team, since
most of our leading Grandmasters were not playing. --- To be honest, I was
intending to have something of a rest during this match, and was counting on
there being a reserve player, but there turned out not to be one, and I had to
play in every round. I won one game, against Ivkov, who committed a
70-year-old theoretical mistake, and the remainder were not particularly
fighting draws. --- We nevertheless won the match. --- It is not at all
surprising that for the main event of the year - the USSR Championship Premier
League - I arrived extremely tired. Here there were many young players,
playing energetically and as equals with more experienced Grandmasters. --- As
usual I lost in the first round to Polugaevsky, but then managed to win
several games, including one against Dvoretsky, which won the best game prize,
and which is given here. --- With a successful run in the middle of the
tournament - during which I played the game against Taimanov given here - I
took the lead. True, the first alarm signal was also heard: in my game with
Vaganian, in a completely won position, I carelessly fell into a cunningly
prepared trap.}) (20. -- {JOURNALIST. It often happens that you are leading,
or are trying to catch a leader. Which is easier? --- CHESS PLAYER. The latter,
of course, since there is an additional stimulus. --- Besides, for me it is
more pleasant to be trying to catch up. If they are chasing me, then the thing
that happened in this USSR Championship in Leningrad is what frequently occurs.
--- In the penultimate round I played Beliavsky, who was performing very
successfully, and who, together with Vaganian, was a point behind me. Simple
logic suggested that as White I should play quietly for a draw, and that's all.
A somewhat prejudiced attitude to youth forced me to fight not for 'my' gold
medal, but 'for the honour' of my chess generation. As a result I overlooked
one move by my opponent, and from being in my favour, the position became
level, then worse, and after a further mistake - lost. --- There were now two
of us in front, and level is how Beliavsky and I finished up. --- Once again a
year ended, and once again there began a lengthy pause. True, I studied chess,
but not altogether in my usual way: at the request of Anatoly Karpov I spent
some time with him, for we believed that the Fischer-Karpov match would take
place ...}) *

{At the beginning of April the position regarding the World Championship
became clear, and I set off to the tournament in Las Palmas. A very
interesting and unusual resort, but... Not only the old hands of the
tournament, who were taking part for the fourth time, but even the local
residents could not remember such cold weather at that time of the year. The
mean April temperature in Las Palmas is 20~/=C, whereas for us it was around
14~/=C. There was no question of any bathing or long walks. --- About half of
the participants in the tournament were contenders for the top places - all
were Grandmasters of excellent repute, and with a high Elo coefficient. The
other half could objectively only hope for isolated sensational success, and
that is how it worked out. --- The game with Mecking gave me a poor start to
the tournament. Twice I committed inaccuracies, then equalised the position,
but not long before the first time control 'found' almost the only losing move.
--- The furious start by Grandmaster Ljubojevic settled the question of first
place several rounds before the finish. Just when I gained some illusory hopes
of catching him, I overlooked a mate against Olafsson, again on the back rank,
just as in the Alekhine Memorial Tournament. --- From my games I can pick out
the attack against Pomar, and the following encounter, which was awarded a
special prize for the most interesting game of the tournament.} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3

{When football interferes with work... --- The seventh round of the Olympiad
Preliminaries. The USSR team is confidently leading in its group. Their next
opponent is the Mongolian team. One of the federations - football or chess -
has made a hash of things. 'Is it really necessary for the Chess Olympiad and
the Football World Cup to be played at the same time?', gloomily joked
football supporters from various countries, who had gathered in Nice on chess
matters. There were various degrees of distraction. Thus the leader of the
Brazilian players, H. Mecking, preferred to spend his playing time by the
television screen, and his team was awarded a loss by default. Others,
fortunately, were more restrained. Other things being equal they were not
against concluding their game from the seventh round a little earlier, since
on this day the Football World Cup opened with the match between Brazil and
Yugoslavia.} 1. c4 {The Mongolian is a player with a strong leaning towards

{M. Dvoretsky is a player who is hard to beat. Appearing in the Premier League
of the USSR Championship for the first time, he lost only one game, although
he had a number of difficult positions. In this game, however, he allowed his
opponent too much.} 1. d4 {As I have recently come to realise, this is also
not a bad move ...} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Be2 O-O 6. Nf3 e5 7.
Be3 ({Along with} 7. O-O) (7. d5) ({or even} 7. dxe5 {this is a perfectly
possible continuation, by which, however, to judge from the present game, it
is difficult for White to count on an opening advantage.}) 7... c6 ({I cannot
claim to have had a great deal of experience in playing this variation, but
here either} 7... Nc6) ({or} 7... Nbd7 {has normally been played against me.})
({For a certain time the move} 7... Qe7 {was also popular. As Dvoretsky
admitted after the game, at literally the last minute he glanced through
Boleslavsky's book, and noticed that the author recommends the modest pawn
move ...c6. For the moment Black refrains from developing his queen's knight.
I thought for some time, but could not find anything better than castling.
Perhaps 8 d5!? should be played here.}) 8. O-O exd4 9. Bxd4 ({I definitely did
not like the position after} 9. Nxd4 Re8 10. f3 ({or} 10. Bf3 Nbd7 {but
capturing with the bishop is also fairly harmless}) 10... d5 11. cxd5 cxd5 12.
Bb5 Bd7 {.}) 9... Re8 10. Qc2 Nbd7 {Perhaps Black shouldn't have been in a
hurry to make this move.} ({The direct} 10... Qe7 11. Rfe1 c5 {deserved
attention, when White has to make a choice: either to give up his bishop, or a
pawn by} 12. Be3 Nxe4 13. Nxe4 Qxe4 14. Qd2 {for which he would obtain some
compensation.}) 11. Rad1 Qe7 12. Rfe1 Ne5 ({In reply to} 12... Nc5 {, which
appears more purposeful, I was intending to continue} 13. b4 {when it turns
out that the threat to the e-pawn is illusory:} Ncxe4 ({Black could have
continued} 13... Ne6 14. Be3 Ng4 {, with a complicated game}) 14. Bd3 d5 15.

have to worry about his e-pawn.}) 13. h3 Bh6 {An interesting move, which in
effect forces White to go in for complications, which prove, however, to be in
his favour. Against other moves, White would have time to regroup by Be3 and
Qd2 with positional pressure.} 14. b4 $1 {The threat of 14...c5 was rather
unpleasant.} b6 15. c5 $1 {As we have already said, this is forced, but quite
good.} bxc5 {After the game a dejected Dvoretsky said that he simply forgot
about the transposition of moves which occurred in the game. For my own part,
I thought for a long time before making my next move.} ({Since I was quite
happy about the main variation (after the preparatory} 15... Nxf3+ 16. Bxf3
bxc5 17. bxc5 dxc5 18. Be3 Bxe3 19. Rxe3 {, when White has more than
sufficient compensation for the pawn, I hesitated, wondering whether it was
worth trying to find anything better. Then I decided that White could obtain a
more appreciable advantage.}) 16. Nxe5 dxe5 ({Better chances were probably
offered by} 16... cxd4 17. Nxc6 Qb7 {.}) 17. Bxc5 Qb7 {White has a clear
positional advantage, but, as we have already said, obtaining an advantage in
a game with Dvoretsky is only the start of the battle.} 18. Na4 {The knight
heads for the blockading square c5.} Be6 (18... Bf8 {was more stubborn.}) 19.
Bd6 Nd7 20. Nc5 Nxc5 21. bxc5 $1 {... a transformation of advantages has taken
place: instead of pressure on the weak c-pawn and occupation of the c5-square,
White has obtained another, much more important advantage: undisputed (as long
as the bishop on d6 is alive) possession of the b-file.} Bf8 ({I thought that} 
21... Qb4 {was more active, so as to answer} 22. Rb1 {with} Qa3 {. I was
intending to play 22 Ba6 forcing the black queen to guard the b7-square.}) 22.
Rb1 {Not deviating from the general plan.} ({The move in the game involves a
clever trap. At first I began considering interesting variations of the type} 
22. Bxe5 Bxa2 23. Ba1 Qb3 24. Qd2 Bxc5 ({bad is} 24... Rxe4 25. Bf3 Rxe1+ 26.
Rxe1 Bg7 27. Bxg7 Kxg7 28. Ra1 $1) 25. Qg5 {. The variations appeared
sufficiently convincing, but I hesitated to open the sluices for the black
pieces. I was right: on 22 Bxe5 Black had prepared 22...Bb3!, not only
securing opposite-coloured bishops, but also winning back the pawn!}) 22... Qd7
23. Red1 {All White's pieces are directed against the queenside.} Bxd6 24. cxd6
$1 {Yet another transformation. White goes in for a variation, the point of
which lies in his quiet 27th move.} Rab8 25. a4 {A new trump comes into play.
The march of this pawn to a6 followed by the intrusion on b7 must decide the
issue.} Rxb1 26. Qxb1 Qd8 {It only remains for Black to play 27...Qb6, and his
position will be tenable, but ...} 27. Qc2 $1 {... and it turns out that on 27.

cheerless occupation - that of blockading the pawn on d6.} Qd7 28. Qc5 f6 (

to think about the black king!}) 32. Qe3+ ({This is more accurate than} 32. Rb7

{Up till the sixth round, in which this game was played, the two players had
made a pretty poor showing. This applies in particular to the Dutch master
playing White: his column in the tournament table showed a string of five
successive noughts. It has long been known that such an opponent is doubly
dangerous (this is shown by the following rounds, where Bohm scored two
successive wins), since his series is always liable to come to an end.} 1. d4 {
The Dutch master has only recently appeared on the international scene, so
that there are few of his games in chess publications.} ({To be honest, for
some reason I expected} 1. e4 {.}) 1... Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 g6 4. Nc3 Bg7 {At
this point it is still early for Black to decide whether or not to play ...d6,
but after ...} 5. e4 O-O 6. Bd3 {... it became clear that Bohm was aiming for
a system which is popular at present, in which Black's position is on the
whole not very comfortable, and unpromising as regards playing for a win.} ({
This system is characterised by the moves} 6. Bd3 d6 7. h3 e6 8. Nf3 exd5 9.

interest.} 7. h3 ({White can of course play} 7. e5 Ne8 {, but this would mean
rejecting his intended plan.}) 7... exd5 8. exd5 Re8+ 9. Be3 {It is not
difficult to see that after 9...d6 10 Nf3, a position is reached from the
system mentioned above, but Black is by no means bound to hurry with the
development of his queenside pieces. True, as the sequel shows, he should not
have overdone this.} Nh5 ({On} 9... Bh6 {the natural} 10. Nf3 {suggests itself,
and, as practice has shown, it is extremely dangerous for Black to capture the
pawn.}) 10. Nge2 {Black's first achievement. White is unable to develop his
knight at f3 in view of 10...Ng3!} d6 11. g4 $5 {An interesting decision.} ({

unfavourable for Black, since his queen's knight comes quickly and effectively
into play. The move made by Bohm is without doubt the strongest.}) 12... Nf6

the board)} 18. Nec3 Bxc3+ 19. Nxc3 Ba6 {when it turns out that White cannot

position would remain sharp, but Black would have nothing to complain about.

pawn (which is significant), but also (and this is very important) a loss of
time. In addition, Black had simply overlooked a tactical possibility on move
