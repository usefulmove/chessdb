{ If you enjoy this study, please click the heart button under the h1
square! } 1.d4 d5 2.Bf4
{ Bf4 is the most accurate London System move order, as opposed to Nf3 on
move 2 or 3. If you play Nf3 too early, you can run into some major move
order issues, and also, early Nf3 interrupts the d1-h5 diagonal. Magnus Carlsen won this game for this reason. [%csl Gf4][%cal Bg1f3,Yd1h5] }

Nf3 you will run into some nasties with Bf5. See the sideline to see the

6...c4 ( 6...Bf5 7.dxc5 Qxb3 8.axb3 ) 7.Qc2
{ Black has fixed the pawn structure passively, so the way white needs to
play is to later on break the structure with e4 or b3, as he does in the
game [%csl Bc4,Bd5][%cal Rb2b3,Rb3c4,Re3e4,Re4d5] } 7...Nh5
{ Black wants the dark squared bishop [%cal Rh5f4] } 8.Bg5 h6 9.Bh4 g5

diagonal. [%csl Gg3][%cal Gg3b8] } 11...Bf5 12.Qc1 e6 13.Ngf3

whole: Ne5! Not only putting his piece on a great square, but vacating f3
for the bishop! [%csl Ge5,Gf3][%cal Ge2f3,Gf3d5] } 17...Nxe5 18.Bxe5 f6

London System in the opening by putting care into your move order, the
middlegame by using your minor pieces to pressurize the center, and even the endgame, by showing us how to activate and coordinate our pieces.

{ Gata Kamsky, one of the best advocates of the London System, plays white
in this game. This game teaches us a lot about the London System and the
type of chess it brings, from the opening stages and development, to the middlegame pawn structures, to the end stages where white's pieces come to
life superbly. } 1.d4 Nf6 2.Bf4 d5 3.e3 c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.Nd2 Bf5

5...Nc6 6.Nbd2 Be7

{ But c4 is not a very good move, and you will probably see it occasionally
in your London System games. The reason why it is not very good is because
it is passively removing the tension from the center, it gives white the active pawn breaks like b3 and e4, and by closing the center, it allows white
to attack on the wings very well, as he does in the game. [%csl Bb3,Be4][%cal Rc5c4,Bb2b3,Be3e4] }

this Ne5 move is a key move to know. [%csl Ge5][%cal Yf6h5,Gd1h5] } 9...Nxe5
