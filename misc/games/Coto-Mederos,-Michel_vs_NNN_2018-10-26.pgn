1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 e6 3.Bf4 { My opponent is very good playing Indian Systems,
he knows very well those positions. We have played many games before, that's
why I decided to play something different, to get him out of his comfort zone.
So I decided to play a London System scheme. } 3...c5 4.e3 b6 5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nbd2 Nc6 7.O-O Be7 8.h3 { This is very typical in this system, the idea is to
clear h2 for my bishop, so I won't have to trade it for the knight after Nh5. } 8...O-O 9.c3 d5 10.Qe2 Bd6 { And actually, White got nothing in the opening. This
is an even position. But this was more less part of the plan, the idea is that
I feel well playing this kind of quiet positions, as my opponent prefers more
complicated situations. } 11.Bxd6 Qxd6 12.Ba6!? { If we look at the central
fixed pawns, we can see that my bishop is good, as his bishop should be bad.
Then this exchange doesn't make any sense... However, this idea is more less
typical and very interesting when the opponent has made the fianchetto in the
queenside, because now there will be some weak clear squares in that wing of
the board. } 12...Rab8 13.Bxb7 Rxb7 14.Rfd1 e5? { And this is the most important
moment of the game. The queen is in the same file than my rook at d1, but
there are many pieces in the middle. However, White has a simple, but very
strong tactic sequence. } 15.Nc4!! dxc4 16.dxe5 Qe6 17.Rd6! ( { Better than } 17.exf6 gxf6 $16 ) 17...Qe7 18.Rxc6 Nd7 19.Qxc4 Nxe5 20.Nxe5 Qxe5 21.Rd1 { Now White has a pawn and the open file, the rest is also instructive. } 21...Re7 22.Rcd6 g6 23.R1d5 Qg7 24.Qf4 f5 25.Rd8 Qf6 26.Qb8 Rxd8 27.Rxd8+ Kg7 28.Qd6 Qxd6 29.Rxd6 Rc7 30.c4 Kf7 31.g3 Ke7 32.Rd5 h5?! { Now there is another
weakness at g6. } 33.Kg2 Ke6 34.h4 Kf6 35.Rd6+ Kg7 36.Kf3 Re7 37.b3 Kh6 38.Ke2 Kg7 39.Kd3 Kf7 { And this is the moment to create a passed pawn. Black
pieces are tied, king has to protect g6 and the rook can't go out of 7th rank. } 40.f3 Kg7 41.e4 fxe4+ 42.fxe4 Kf7 43.Ke3 Kg7 44.Kf4 { Black resigned.
Nothing stops e5, Ke4-d5... }  1-0
