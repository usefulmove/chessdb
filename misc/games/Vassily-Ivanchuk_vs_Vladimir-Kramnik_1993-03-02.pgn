{ Comments by Kramnik } 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 d6 6.Bc4 Qb6 7.Nb3 e6 8.Bf4!? { At the time this was either a new move, or its first appearance in high-level chess (instead of the generally accepted 8.Bg5, with a complicated and roughly equal game). Now, however, both Kasparov and Anand, and many other grandmasters constantly resort to this idea of Ivanchuk, who over the years has made a mass of opening discoveries. I perhaps did not react in the strongest way, but successfully enough against the new move, which is much more dangerous than it appears at first sight. } 8...Ne5 9.Be2 a6 ( { In recent times } 9...Bd7 { has been considered more accurate. This is what I played against Kasparov, Horgen 1995, where I equalised without the slightest difficulty; I also won against Judit Polgar in Dortmund 1997. But the theory of the variation is still developing, and the last word here has not yet been said. } ) ( { It can be added that after } 9...Be7?! 10.Be3 Qc7 { White gains an advantage both with } 11.Nb5 ( { and with the immediate } 11.f4 Nc4 12.Bxc4 Qxc4 13.Qf3 { followed by queenside castling and the e4-e5 breakthrough. } ) 11...Qb8 12.f4 Ng6 13.Nc3 { , when the knight at g6 is badly placed. } ) 10.Bg3!? ( { In the event of } 10.O-O Be7 11.Be3 Qc7 { Black has no problems. } ) ( { But today } 10.Be3 Qc7 11.f4 { is more common, with the plan indicated above. This is what Ivanchuk played against me at the Paris rapidplay in 1995. This is possibly stronger, but the retreat of the bishop to g3 is significantly more cunning. } ) 10...h5! { An intuitive, one could say 'genuinely Sicilian', and very strong move, with which I was happy. } ( { White could have developed a serious initiative in the variation } 10...Qc7 11.f4 Nc4 12.e5 dxe5 13.fxe5 Nxe5 14.Qd4 Nfd7 15.O-O-O { . I did not find a forced in here for White, but this position did not appeal to me. And although I saw that with my tenth move I was condemning my king to a 'dangerous life' in the centre, I sensed that due to dynamic features Black should not be clearly worse, and that I could hope for counterplay. } ) 11.h3 ( { Of course, } 11.f4? { would not do at all due to } 11...Neg4 ) ( { But } 11.f3 { came into consideration, when Black should play something like } 11...Qc7 12.Qd4!? h4 13.Bf2 b5 14.a4 Nc6! 15.Qd2 b4 16.Nd1 d5 { with the initiative. } ) 11...Qc7 12.f4 ( { Now nothing is achieved by } 12.Qd4 b5 13.a4 Nc6 14.Qe3 Nb4! 15.Bd3 bxa4 16.Rxa4 Rb8 { , when Black is at least equal. } ) ( { However, this is also the case after } 12.a4 Bd7 13.Qd4 Rc8 { , where he wins the battle for the c4-square. } ) 12...Nc4 13.Bxc4 { An acknowledgement that White has no opening advantage (and, incidentally, played after half an hour's thought). } ( { The maximum that White could have achieved was a complicated game with chances for both sides in the variation } 13.Qd4 b5 14.e5 dxe5 15.fxe5 Bb7 16.O-O Rd8 17.Qf2 Ne4 18.Nxe4 Bxe4 { , although in this case he would also risk ending up in an inferior position. } ) 13...Qxc4 14.Qf3 h4! { Another precise move. } 15.Bh2 ( { The idea of 14....h4 is to drive the bishop to an unfavourable position, since after } 15.Bf2 b5! 16.e5 ( 16.O-O-O Qc7 { with approximate equality. } ) 16...Nd5 17.Nxd5 Qxd5 18.Qxd5 exd5 19.O-O-O ( 19.exd6 Bxd6 { , and the f4-pawn is "hanging". } ) 19...dxe5 20.fxe5 Bf5! { Black solves all his problems. } ) 15...Bd7 16.O-O-O Rc8 17.Rhe1 { A natural move, on which for some reason my opponent spent a quarter of an hour out of his already small amount of remaining time. } 17...b5! ( { More energetic than } 17...Be7 { , which, however, is also quite good. } ) 18.Qf2? { After this Black seizes the initiative. } ( 18.a3 { was better, when the position, in my opinion, is of dynamic balance. In Ivanchuk's defence I should mention that he had little more than 15 minutes remaining on his clock, whereas I still had a good half hour. } ) 18...Qc7! 19.e5 b4 20.Rd3!? ( { A reasonable chance, since after } 20.exf6 bxc3 21.f5 cxb2+ 22.Kb1 e5 23.fxg7 Bxg7 { things are completely bad for White, } 24.f6 Bxf6 ) 20...dxe5 21.fxe5 bxc3 22.Rxc3 ( { Black also finds a defence after } 22.exf6 Qxh2 23.Rxd7 Qg3! 24.Qxg3 hxg3 25.Ra7 cxb2+ 26.Kxb2 gxf6 27.Rxa6 f5 ) 22...Qxc3 ( 22...Qb8 { semmed dangerous to me, but in fact it was the strongest, e.g. } 23.Rxc8+ Bxc8 24.Rf1! Rh7! 25.Qf4 Be7 26.exf6 Qxf4+ 27.Bxf4 gxf6 { and the ending is quite hopless for White. } ) 23.bxc3 Ba3+ 24.Kd2? { In time trouble White overlooks a defensive resource, which was pointed out later by Anand: } ( 24.Kb1 Nd5 25.Bf4! { , and the position becomes extremely sharp with chances for both sides. Such is the value of a move at this moment. the mistake made by White is not really so appreciable, and energetic play is still demanded of Black, but it would appear that the outcome of the game is already decided. } ) 24...Nd5 25.Re4 Rxc3 26.Rg4 ( { if } 26.Rxh4 { then after } 26...O-O { followed by ...Rfc8. } ) 26...O-O { The black rook, which has been asleep for a long time at h8, comes into play with decisive effect. } 27.Qxh4 Rfc8 28.Nd4 Bb4 29.Ke2 Bb5+! { The lone White king is attacked by all the Black pieces! } 30.Nxb5 ( { Black would have won prettily in the variation } 30.Kf2 Rxc2+ 31.Nxc2 Rxc2+ 32.Kf3 ( 32.Kg1 Rc1+ 33.Kf2 Rf1+ 34.Kg3 Be1# ) 32...Be2+ 33.Ke4 Rc4# ) 30...Rxc2+ 31.Kf3 axb5 32.Rxb4 { Played a few seconds before the fall of his flag. } 32...Nxb4 33.Qxb4 R8c3+ { White resigns. }  0-1
