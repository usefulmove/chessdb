break through the centre, but is more concerned with building up for himself a
strong position, to enable him subsequently to prepare an attack on the King's
side.}  4... d6 5. c3 { The position of the pawns on c3 and e4, which makes the

today, originates from Steinitz. As a fact we find very often in Steinitz's
games these extended Knight manoeuvres. With Morphy, who always brought about
an open game, that kind of manoeuvre was impossible; as he dared not permit
himself in open positions to lose so much time. Noteworthy and typical of
Steinitz is the delay in castling: so that the possibility of castling on the
Queen's side remained open to him.}  6... Bg7 7. Nf1 O-O 8. Ba4 { in order to

that Black's counterplay against White's centre does not lend itself to a
successful result on account of the latter's assured position. Equally
remarkable is it that the move h4 is not to be found in analogous games of

he brought the Knight for an attack on the Queen by way of Ng5 to Ne6 without
any loss of time. But on e6 the Knight is not favourably placed, because it

Black is therefore confronted with the difficulty arising from his inability to turn both Rooks to account. How does Lasker meet does difficulties? He has recourse to an idea which may not strike the layman as being anything extraordinary, but which to the expert seems as original as it is bold.

to reap an advantage from the weakness of White's Pawns. It would have been a

terrain develop better with fewer pieces. The essential error, that causes
Schlechter later on to lose, was his lack of consitency. Whilst, in the first
instance, he seeks in his cramped position to make matters easier by
exchanging, he afterwards adopts the plan of freeing himself, generally by
advancing his pawns to d5 or c5. But Black, after the time lost by Nxd4, has no

1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.c4 {The idea of the Queen's Gambit is to excercise
pressure on the Bishop's file. If Black plays in order to avoid such pressure
sooner or later White's Pawn in c4, by an exchange of pawns in the centre,
isolates the Pawn at d5 and attacks the latter.} 3...e6 4.Nc3 Be7 5.Bg5 c5
6.cxd5 {(Cf. the foregoing note.)} 6...exd5 7.e3 Nc6 8.Bb5 cxd4 9.Nxd4 Bd7
{Lasker is the dramatist of the chess board who understands how to create
situations and complications out of nothing and always to awaken increasing
tension. He does not at this stage of the game seek to effect what the
position demands, namely, the protection of the weak pawn at d5, but will
fashion the ultimate eventuality according to his own ideas.

Rubinstein sees now that he can win the pawn at d5 but in order to do so must
undergo an apparently irresistible attack. This attack which Black will obtain
looks so dangerous that even players known for their boldness would not have
ventured to take the pawn. Rubinstein is not bold but anxious; frequently over
anxious. Often when his opponent with a bad game, and with the intention of
giving to it a different turn, has sacrificed something, Rubinstein has not
accepted the sacrifice made thus in desperation, but has preferred to go on
with the original positional idea of his game and thus to lead up to a more
tardy yet certain victory.

But in the game before us (cf. note to move 3) the attack on the pawn at d5 is
the positional idea underlying the scheme of his game. Should he not take the
pawn he ceases to be that humble and submissive player, who puts his trust in
his idea and obey its promptings; so in the end he does take the pawn with
fear and trembling, yet with confidence and certainty that what is right must
prevail.} 10.Bxf6 Bxf6 11.Nxd5 Bxd4 12.exd4 Qg5 13.Bxc6 {Evidently this
exchange is forced.} 13...Bxc6 {This open and beautiful position which Lasker
has attained in a few moves in the defence of a Queen's Gambit is indeed an
admirable example of his genius for positions.} 14.Ne3 O-O-O {Lasker adds to
the tension.} ( {With} 14...Bxg2 {he would release such tension to White's advantage,
viz.:} 15.Rg1 Qa5+ 16.Qd2 Qxd2+ 17.Kxd2 Be4 {(so as to be able to play Bg6
after 18. Rxg7)} 18.Rac1 {and White will make an inroad into Black's game.} )
15.O-O Rhe8 {It looks now as if White to meet the threat Rxe3 must play 16. g3
whereupon Black's attack would be overwhelming. Still Rubinstein cannot
believe that he is lost. He believes in his ideas and again has played
accordingly. Imbued with this belief he looks for his salvation, that is for
the "miracle", which must come to the rescue of the true believer who has
never swerved from his conviction.} 16.Rc1! Rxe3 ( {If} 16...Kb8 {then} 17.Rc5 Qg6

his Pawn.} ) 17.Rxc6+ bxc6 18.Qc1!! {This is the "miracle". Whatever move
Black makes now, White turns the Pawn gained to account and ultimately wins
the end game.} *

1.d4 Nf6 2.Nd2 d5 3.e3 {Breyer, in close games, likes his Bishops to keep behind his chain of pawns. Therefore he avoids early exchanges and can prepare undisturbed for the attack. It is surprising in his games how, when the decisive break through occurs, the pieces which had appeared shut in, suddenly become alive. One should compare with regard to this, Tartakower's picture of Breyer's method of play in Chapter IX of his book.} 3...Bf5 4.c4 c6 5.Ngf3 e6 6.Be2 Bd6 7.c5! Bc7 8.b4 Nbd7 9.Bb2 {White next thwarts Black's e5 and with b5 and Qa4 intends to attack c6 which is difficult to defend.} 9...Ne4 10.Nxe4 dxe4 {The move that was made at least looks very good. The Knight at d7 is to be brought to d5; besides White dare not castle on the King's side without exposing himself to an overwhelming attack. Breyer by the following play takes advantage of the unfavourable position of the Bishop at f5 in a manner as beautiful as it is original.}

later on to force Black's a6 and b5 so as to weaken Black's Queen's wing and

sacrifice gives the game an entirely changed aspect. The White pieces were in

sacrifice is now thwarted.} 16.Qxb5 a4 17.Nd2 Rfb8 18.Qe2 Nf6 19.Nf3 Ne4
