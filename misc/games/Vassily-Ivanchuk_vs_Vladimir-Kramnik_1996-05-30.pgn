Now White has problems with his development and the defence of his f-pawn. } ( 16...Nc6? 17.Nxb5! ) 17.g3? { This is, of course, a radical attempt to solve all White's problems, but a very unfortunate one. } ( { However, also after } 17.Qf3 { he black pieces wold have become extremely active: } 17...Bb7 18.Qe3 Bd6! 19.Ne2 O-O { with full compensation. } ) 17...Nb6 18.Qf3 Bb7 19.Ne4 f5! ( { After } 19...O-O 20.Bg2 Rc8 { Black has excellent compensation for the sacrificed exchange, for example, } 21.Qe2 Na4 { with the threat of ....Bxe4 and ...Bf6, but I reckoned that my position already allowed me to hope for more. } ) 20.Qh5+ Kf8 21.Nf2 ( { it is not hard to see that Black easily parries "attacks" such as } 21.Ng5 Bxg5 22.fxg5 Bxh1 ) 21...Bf6 ( { Again in search for more, I rejected the chance of gaining a slight advantage after } 21...Bxh1 22.Nxh1 Bf6 ) 22.Bd3 { An interesting attempt to play for a counterattack, especially as it is not apparent how White can defend. } ( { The point is that my light-square bishop can often join the attack, for example, after } 22.Rg1? Na4 23.Nd3 Be4! 24.Qe2 Nxb2! 25.Nxb2 Qc3 26.Nd3 Qa1+ 27.Kd2 Bc3+ 28.Ke3 Bd4+ { , picking up the rook, and I was reluctant to exchange it for a rook. Of course, all these 'positional considerations' were accompanied by the calculation of numerous specific variations. } ) ( { After } 22.Re1 { even } 22...Qd6!? { is quite good. } ) 22...Na4! ( { Of course, not } 22...Bxh1 23.Rxh1 Na4 24.Nd1 { when White holds on. } ) 23.Rhe1 Bxb2+ 24.Kb1 { despite the apparent abundance of threats, it is not so simple to mate White, whereas the black king is also beginning to feel uncomfortable, and so.... } 24...Bd5! { Simultaneously defending and attacking. } ( { If } 24...Qe7 { White calmly plays } 25.Bxf5 { , intending to reply to } 25...Bf6 { with } 26.Bxe6 ) 25.Bxb5 ( 25.Bxf5 { would have led to a piquant mate- } 25...Bxa2+ 26.Kxa2 Qc4+ 27.Kb1 Nc3+ 28.Kxb2 Qb4+ 29.Kc1 Na2# ) 25...Bxa2+ ( 25...axb5? 26.Rxd5 ) 26.Kxa2 axb5 27.Kb1 Qa5 { Somewhat short of time, Black overlooks a much simpler win: } ( 27...Qe7! 28.Rd3 Qb4 { When aiming for this position from afar, I was afraid of the checks available to White } 29.Rd8+ { , but it is easy to see that they do not save him. } ) 28.Nd3? ( 28.Rxe6? Nc3+ 29.Kxb2 Qb4+ ) ( 28.Rd7 Qxe1+ 29.Nd1 Kg8! 30.Qg6 Bf6 ) ( 28.c3!

The knight at d5 blocks the d-file, and the opponent's counterplay is a little too late. If } 33.Nb2 Qa3 { . White resigns. }  0-1
