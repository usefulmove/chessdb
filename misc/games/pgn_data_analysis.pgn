{ White's lonely bishop is not able to restrain Black's pawns from breaking into queens, therefore... } 1.Bd2 g2 ( { or } 1...h2 { that doesn't change anything. } ) 2.Ba5! { Why did the White's bishop go to the edge of the chessboard? The answer will be given by the next move! } 2...g1=Q 3.b4 { and no matter how Black try, they cannot give White the opportunity to make the next move. Stalemate! }  1/2-1/2
