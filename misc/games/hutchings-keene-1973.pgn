1. c4 { Notes by Raymond Keene. } Nf6 2. Nc3 b6 3. Nf3 {3 e4!?
is more energetic} 3...Bb7 4. d4 e6 5. g3 {? This variation is
fairly harmless. More aggressive are 5 e3 and 5 Bg5.} 5...Bb4
6. Bd2 c5 {! Black already has an excellent position.} 7. a3
{Perhaps 7 dxc5 could be tried.} 7...Bxc3 8. Bxc3 Ne4 9. Qc2
{?! More accurate is 9 Rc1.} 9...Nxc3 10. Qxc3 Qf6 {! This
aggressive move forces weaknesses in White's pawn structure
all over the board. } 11. Rd1 Bxf3 12. Qxf3 Qxf3 13. exf3 Nc6
14. dxc5 {?! This adds the b-file to Black's gains. 14 d5 was
the last chance.} 14...bxc5 15. Bg2 Rb8 {Black obviously has a
great advantage, but what distinguishes this game, after
White's inept handling of the opening is the way in which
Black forces entry into the white fortress. The elements to be
combined are pressure in the b-file, an outpost for the black
rook on b3 and the unchallengeable black knight on d4. It is
interesting that in spite of the numerous exchanges the
cumulative effect of all these pluses leads to black victory
in a mere seven moves.} 16. Rd2 Rb3 17. Kd1 Ke7 18. f4 Nd4
19. Kc1 h5 {!! By threatening ...h4-h3 Black forces White to
weaken his pawn on g3.} 20. h4 Rhb8 {The threat is now
21...Rxg3! 22 fxg3 Nb3+ 23 Kc2 Nxd2 24 Kxd2 Rxb2+-+.} 21. Bf1
Rf3 {! This is totally decisive. White has no defence to the
twin threats of ...Nb3+ and ...Rxa3.} 22. Kd1 {If 22 Kb1 Rxa3
all the same.} 22...Rxa3 {The White fortifications have
crumbled for if 23 bxa3 Rb1 mate.} 0-1
